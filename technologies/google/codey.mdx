## Key Capabilities

- **Wide Language Support:** Codey supports multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, JavaScript, Go, TypeScript, and GoogleSQL.
- **Advanced Code Completion:** Using the code-gecko model, Codey provides context-sensitive code suggestions, significantly accelerating the coding process.
- **Dynamic Code Generation:** Leveraging the code-bison model, Codey can generate entire code snippets based on natural language prompts.
- **Interactive Code Chat:** The codechat-bison model enables developers to interact with an intelligent bot for various tasks, including debugging, documentation, and learning new concepts.

## Use Cases and Models

Codey's advanced capabilities cater to numerous use cases throughout the software development lifecycle:

| Use Case | Codey Models |
|----------|--------------|
| Code completion | code-gecko |
| Code generation | code-bison, codechat-bison |
| Documentation in comments | codechat-bison |
| Release notes generation | codechat-bison |
| Unit test generation | code-bison, codechat-bison |
| Code explanation | codechat-bison |
| Code fixing | code-bison, codechat-bison |
| Code optimization | code-bison, codechat-bison |
| Code translation | code-bison, codechat-bison |

### Code Generation with code-bison

The code-bison model specializes in code generation tasks that can be completed with a single API response. Common use cases include:

- Writing functions based on problem descriptions
- Creating classes with specified purposes
- Generating unit tests for given functions
