# MindsDB Knowledge Base

MindsDB’s Knowledge Base (KB) is a specialized data store designed to work with MindsDB’s machine learning and AI capabilities, allowing users to manage and retrieve knowledge in an AI-optimized environment. As part of MindsDB's open-source ML and AI integration platform, the Knowledge Base is configured for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of structured information, which can then be used in machine learning models or other AI-driven tasks. KB leverages embedding models and vector databases, making it particularly effective for natural language and AI applications.
