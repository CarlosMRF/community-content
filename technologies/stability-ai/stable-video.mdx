## **Stable Video Specifications**

Stable Video comes in two models, generating 14 and 25 frames respectively, at frame rates ranging from 3 to 30 FPS. These models have shown to surpass leading closed models in user preference studies.

* **Video duration:** 2-5 seconds
* **Frame rate:** Up to 30 FPS
* **Processing time:** 2 minutes or less

### **Stable Video License**

Stable Video Diffusion is available under a non-commercial community license. Review the full License and Stability’s Acceptable Use Policy [here](https://stability.ai/license).

### **Evaluation**

A user preference study comparing SVD Image-to-Video with GEN-2 and PikaLabs shows a higher preference for SVD in terms of video quality. Details are available in the research paper.

### **Uses**

Intended for research, Stable Video can be utilized in generative model research, model safety, understanding model limitations, artistic creation, and educational tools. It is not designed for factual or true representations and should adhere to Stability AI's Acceptable Use Policy.

### **Limitations and Recommendations**

The model produces short videos with potential limitations in motion, photorealism, and text rendering. It is primarily for research purposes.
