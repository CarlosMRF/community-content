# Vectara: The Future of Search

Vectara is the trusted GenAI platform. 
It's designed to make it easy for you to build and deploy GenAI applications that can generate text-based answers using your particular data 
(this type of application flow is also known as RAG or retrieval-augmented-generation). 
You just ingest your data and then build apps using the Query and Summarization APIs. It's that simple.
