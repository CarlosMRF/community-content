# Cohere Embed

**Cohere Embed** is an advanced text representation model designed to convert text into numerical embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of text, allowing machine learning applications to process and compare language based on meaning rather than keywords. The embeddings are essential for tasks such as **semantic search**, **topic modeling**, **recommendation systems**, and **text classification**.

## Embed and Embed Jobs

Cohere's Embed models can be used through two main endpoints:
- **[Embed](https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/embed)**: This endpoint generates embeddings from text for various NLP tasks such as estimating semantic similarity, ranking text sequences, and categorizing text.
- **[Embed Jobs](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/embed-jobs)**: This endpoint allows for large-scale embedding tasks, such as embedding large datasets asynchronously, perfect for applications with big data requirements.

Both endpoints are versatile, offering support for different languages, and enable tasks like semantic search and text classification with high performance and speed.

## Embed Models

Cohere offers a range of embedding models optimized for different languages and tasks. The current lineup includes:

| Model Name                    | Description                                                                               | Dimensions | Context Length | Similarity Metrics                                 | Endpoints           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **embed-english-v3.0**         | A powerful model for English text, supporting classification and embeddings.              | 1024       | 512            | Cosine Similarity, Dot Product, Euclidean Distance | Embed, Embed Jobs   |
| **embed-english-light-v3.0**   | A smaller, faster version of the v3.0 English model with almost comparable capabilities.  | 384        | 512            | Cosine Similarity, Dot Product, Euclidean Distance | Embed, Embed Jobs   |
| **embed-multilingual-v3.0**    | Multilingual embedding model supporting classification and embedding across 100+ languages. | 1024       | 512            | Cosine Similarity, Dot Product, Euclidean Distance | Embed, Embed Jobs   |
| **embed-multilingual-light-v3.0** | A faster, lightweight version of the multilingual-v3.0 model with similar performance.  | 384        | 512            | Cosine Similarity, Dot Product, Euclidean Distance | Embed, Embed Jobs   |
