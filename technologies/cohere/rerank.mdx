# Cohere Rerank Family

The **Cohere Rerank Family** is a collection of advanced models specifically designed to improve search systems by reranking results to prioritize the most relevant documents. These models are vital for **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, making them ideal for enterprises seeking to improve the accuracy and relevance of their information retrieval processes. Rerank models excel at handling semi-structured data, long documents, and providing contextually appropriate results across various applications.

## Rerank and its Applications

The **Cohere Rerank** models work by optimizing the ranking of search results based on their semantic relevance to a query. These models are highly effective in environments where search quality directly impacts productivity, such as **enterprise search**, **eCommerce platforms**, **knowledge bases**, and **customer support systems**.

For example, Rerank models can be used for:
- **Enterprise Search**: Improve the relevance of search results for internal documents, helping knowledge workers find accurate and contextual information faster.
- **RAG Systems**: Power Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows by reranking retrieved documents and grounding generative outputs with relevant data.
- **E-commerce Search**: Enhance product search by prioritizing results that are semantically closest to customer queries, improving user experience and conversions.
