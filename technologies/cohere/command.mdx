## Command Family and its Applications

The **Cohere Command** models are tailored to handle complex business tasks, where accuracy and privacy are critical. These models can be fine-tuned to different workflows, making them suitable for a variety of industries. Applications include:

- **Document Processing**: Automate drafting, summarization, and legal documentation using the model's ability to process long text inputs and produce accurate outputs.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Using a retrieval-augmented approach, Command models can pull relevant information from external sources, verify it with citations, and ensure the generated output is reliable and accurate.
- **Conversational AI**: The Command family powers intelligent conversational agents that can handle multi-step reasoning, allowing businesses to automate tasks like customer service and internal knowledge queries.
