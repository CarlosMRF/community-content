# Cohere Classify Model Family

**Cohere Classify** is a flexible text classification framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to group and label text into predefined categories. This includes tasks like sentiment analysis, content moderation, and intent recognition. The classify endpoint allows for **few-shot learning**, meaning it can perform well with minimal labeled examples, making it an ideal solution for users with limited training data.

## Cohere Classify and its Applications

Cohere Classify simplifies the creation of text classifiers by integrating large language models into your applications. These models are capable of categorizing text with high accuracy using few examples, ideal for tasks such as:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral, useful in customer reviews and social media monitoring.
- **Content Moderation**: Detect harmful or inappropriate content such as hate speech, spam, and profanity.
- **Intent Recognition**: Determine user intent in customer support interactions, enhancing automation and response accuracy.

Cohere Classify can also be fine-tuned for specific tasks, offering a balance between flexibility and performance with its robust pre-trained LLMs&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Model Variants

Cohere provides multiple options to suit different classification needs:
| Model Name | Description | Dimensions | Context Length | Similarity Metrics | Endpoints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Classify V2** | Optimized for short texts with high accuracy across various languages. | N/A | N/A | Few-shot classification | `/classify` endpoint |
| **Fine-tuned Classify** | Custom models fine-tuned for specific use cases like sentiment or intent detection. | N/A | N/A | Custom metrics | `/finetune/classify` endpoint |
