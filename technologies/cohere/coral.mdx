### Key Features:
- **Conversational Interface**: Coral supports natural language queries, making it easier for teams to access information. It's like asking a colleague for advice, but with the power of AI.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Enterprises can augment Coral with their own data sources (CRMs, databases, search engines, etc.), enabling Coral to provide highly specific and contextual responses.
- **Citations and Grounding**: To ensure trustworthiness, Coral can generate responses backed by citations from the data it references, helping teams verify the information it provides.
- **Private and Secure Deployment**: Coral is deployed in a private environment, ensuring that all data stays within the company's control. This makes it ideal for industries where data security and confidentiality are paramount, such as legal, finance, and healthcare.

Coral is currently available in **private preview** for select enterprises, focusing on high-priority tasks such as brainstorming, drafting, and research. The tool has already been integrated with platforms like Oracle and Elastic, enhancing productivity across a range of industries.
