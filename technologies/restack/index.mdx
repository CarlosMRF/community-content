## Key Features
- **Event Listening:** Processes real-time events in JSON, audio, or video formats, removing the need for complex queuing systems. This allows workflows to be reactive and continuously adaptive to incoming data streams.

- **Workflow Automation:** Supports the creation of multi-step, decision-based workflows. Users can employ AI models ranging from zero-shot tasks to more complex multi-agent reasoning configurations, accommodating a variety of AI models.

- **Feedback Loops:** Integrates real-time human feedback mechanisms that improve system adaptability and safety, creating feedback loops that reinforce accuracy and compliance.

- **Real-time Scalability:** Scales seamlessly with autonomous systems, adapting in real-time to the demands of various systems

- **Extensibility for Multi-Agent Systems:** Enables developers to extend workflows across multi-agent models, enhancing autonomous system interactions.

## Use Cases
- **Autonomous Decision-Making Systems:** Ideal for industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics that require high-stakes decision-making by intelligent agents.

- **Customer Service Bots:** Develop autonomous customer support agents capable of handling nuanced conversations and providing personalized solutions.

- **Manufacturing Automation:** Enhance operational efficiency in manufacturing with multi-agent systems that can adapt in real-time to production requirements and logistics.

- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Integrate Restack for decision-making processes in self-driving vehicles, enabling faster and more reliable responses to complex driving environments.
