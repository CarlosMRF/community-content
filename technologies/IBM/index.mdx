## Embedding Models:

The slate.125m.english.rtrvr and slate.30m.english.rtrvr models are bi-encoder sentence transformers that generate embeddings for various inputs like queries, passages, or documents. Both models are trained to maximize the cosine similarity between pairs of texts (e.g., a query and a passage), producing sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine similarity.
