# GPT-4o Family of Models

## Overview
The GPT-4o family, introduced in mid-2024, is OpenAI’s advanced multimodal series designed for high-efficiency and interactive applications. Built on the foundation of the GPT-4 architecture, the 4o models process text, images, and audio, supporting highly responsive and nuanced interactions.

## Key Features

1. **Multimodal Capabilities** – Handles text, images, and voice, making it versatile for applications across domains such as customer support, education, and content creation.
2. **Real-Time Voice Interaction** – Responds to audio inputs with minimal latency, allowing for natural, conversational exchanges.
3. **Multilingual Support** – Supports over 50 languages, enabling global accessibility and adaptability.
4. **Cost-Effectiveness** – The model runs twice as fast as GPT-4 Turbo while being 50% more cost-effective, making it attractive for businesses with high interaction volumes.

## Variations

- **GPT-4o Base** – Designed for general multimodal applications, optimized for balanced performance across text, image, and audio inputs.
- **GPT-4o Mini** – A smaller, cost-effective version for high-demand, lower-cost applications, ideal for scaling large deployments.

## Applications

- **Customer Support** – Enables real-time support across text, audio, and images, enhancing user experience.
- **Content Creation and Translation** – Automates content generation and accurate translation across multiple languages.
- **Accessibility Solutions** – Enhances accessibility tools for people with disabilities, using voice and visual processing.

## Getting Started with GPT-4o

While a dedicated tech page is forthcoming, OpenAI offers APIs for developers to experiment with the GPT-4o family in various interactive and multimodal applications.
