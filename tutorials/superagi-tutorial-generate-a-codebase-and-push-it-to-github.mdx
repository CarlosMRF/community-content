## What is SuperAGI?

SuperAGI is an open-source framework that enables developers to build, manage, and run useful autonomous AI agents quickly and reliably. With SuperAGI, you can create agents that can perform various tasks, such as coding, testing, deploying, and more.
In this tutorial, I will show you how to use SuperAGI to generate a codebase and push it to GitHub using the ‚ÄúCoding + Github Push‚Äù Agent template.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. A GitHub account. If you don‚Äôt have one, you can [sign up for free here](https://github.com/).
2. Your GitHub Access Token. You will need a GitHub access token with the necessary permissions for accessing and modifying repositories. You can create one with a few steps:

- Go to **Settings** in your GitHub Account. Then go to **Developer Settings**.
- Click on "**Personal access tokens**". Then click on "**Tokens (classic)**".

- Click on "**Generate new token**". Then choose "**Generate new token (classic)**".

- Write a **Note** about what the token is for and choose an appropriate expiration date.

- Select all the **scopes** so as to have the necessary permissions.
- Click on **Generate New Token**.
- Copy the token and save it in the config.yaml file as the value of `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- Put your Github User Name as the value of `GITHUB_USERNAME`. You can find your GitHub username on your GitHub Profile.
3. SuperAGI installed on your machine. You can [follow the installation instructions here](https://superagi.com/docs/Installation/).
4. For this tutorial, we will use Python and VS Code, but you can use any language and editor you like.

## Creating an agent
In this tutorial we will use an Agent Template from SuperAGI. I will show you how to set up the ‚ÄúCoding + Github Push‚Äù Agent template in detail:
- Go to `localhost:3000`. You should see something like this:

- Go to the Marketplace and select the ‚ÄúCoding + Github Push‚Äù Agent template

- Install it

- Create a new Agent and select the ‚ÄúCoding + Github Push‚Äù Agent template

- Configure the Agent with your desired options or leave it at the default. Make sure to include your GitHub Repository link as well in the third goal

- Click on 'Create and Run' to start the process

- It will generate the code and push it to GitHub. Grab a coffee and let your agent get to work! üòéüçµ.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to use SuperAGI to generate a codebase and push it to GitHub using the ‚ÄúCoding + Github Push‚Äù Agent template. We have also seen how easy and convenient it is to create and manage AI agents with SuperAGI. You can use this template as a starting point for your own projects or try out other templates from the GitHub Marketplace. You can also customize your agents with your own logic and workflows on SuperAGI, that would be in another tutorial, Stay Tuned üî•. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and found it useful.
