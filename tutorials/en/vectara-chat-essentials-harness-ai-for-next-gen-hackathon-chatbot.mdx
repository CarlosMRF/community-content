### Setting Up a Virtual Environment in Python 🐍

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: First, open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal app). Navigate to your project's directory. Then, create a virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with your preferred name for the virtual environment.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - On Windows, run:
     ```bash
     .\myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS or Linux, run:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   You should see the name of your virtual environment in the terminal prompt, indicating that it’s active.

3. **Install Required Libraries**: With the virtual environment active, you can now install the required libraries. Based on your imports, it seems you’ll need `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and `streamlit`.

   - Install them via pip:

     ```python
     pip install requests beautifulsoup4 streamlit streamlit-chat
     ```

### Tips and Best Practices 🌟

- **Manage Dependencies**: Keep track of your dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file for easier setup in different environments.

- **Code Structure**: Organize your code into modules or classes for better maintainability, especially if your project grows in complexity.

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling, particularly for network requests to manage API call failures gracefully.

- **Security**: Be mindful of securing your API keys and customer IDs. Avoid hardcoding them into your source code. Consider using environment variables for storing sensitive information.

- **Testing**: Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they work as expected and to catch any issues early in the development process.

---

## **Creating the `injest.py` Script:**

1. **File Creation:** Within your Streamlit project directory, create a new Python file named `injest.py`.
2. **Adding Imports:** Paste the following lines at the beginning of your `injest.py` file. These lines import necessary libraries for making API calls and working with files:

```python
import os
import requests
import http.client
import json
```

**Explanation of Functions in `injest.py`:**

- **`create_corpus(api_key, customer_id, corpus_name, corpus_description)`:**

  ```python
  def create_corpus(api_key , customer_id ,corpus_name,corpus_description):
      conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.vectara.io")
      payload = json.dumps({
          "corpus": {
              "name": corpus_name,  # Replace with your actual corpus name
              "description": corpus_description,  # Optional
              "enabled": True,  # Optional
              "swapQenc": False,  # Optional
              "swapIenc": False,  # Optional
              "textless": False,  # Optional
              "encrypted": True,  # Optional
              "encoderId": 1,  # Optional, use integer
              "metadataMaxBytes": 0,  # Optional, use integer
              "customDimensions": [],  # Optional
              "filterAttributes": []  # Optional
          }
      })
      headers = {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          'Accept': 'application/json',
          'customer-id': customer_id,  # Your customer ID
          'x-api-key': api_key  # Your API Key
      }
      conn.request("POST", "/v1/create-corpus", payload, headers)
      res = conn.getresponse()
      data = res.read()
      print(data.decode("utf-8"))
      data_dict = json.loads(data.decode("utf-8"))
      corpus_number = data_dict["corpusId"]
      success_message = data_dict["status"]["statusDetail"]

      return corpus_number, success_message

  ```

  - This function is responsible for creating a new corpus in your Vectara account.
  - It accepts four arguments:
    - `api_key`: Your unique Vectara API Key.
    - `customer_id`: Your Vectara customer ID.
    - `corpus_name`: The desired name you want to give to your new corpus.
    - `corpus_description` (optional): A brief description of your corpus (e.g., "Customer feedback data").
  - The function interacts with Vectara's API using the `http.client` library. It builds a request containing details about the new corpus and sends it to Vectara.
  - Upon successful creation, the function retrieves the newly assigned corpus number and a confirmation message. These are then returned by the function for further use in your Streamlit app.

- **`save_to_dir(uploaded_file)`:**

  ```python

  def save_to_dir(uploaded_file):
    if uploaded_file is not None:
        temp_dir = "temp"
        os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)
        file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, uploaded_file.name)

        with open(file_path, "wb") as f:
            f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())

        return file_path


  ```

  - This function serves as a helper to temporarily store uploaded data files on your machine.
  - It takes a single argument, `uploaded_file`, which likely represents an object containing information about the uploaded file from your Streamlit app.
  - The function creates a temporary directory (if it doesn't exist) and then saves the uploaded file to that directory with its original filename.
  - This function might be useful if your Streamlit app allows users to upload data files before creating the corpus.
  - Note that if you're working with data directly in memory within your Streamlit app, you might not need this function.

- **`upload_file(api_key, customer_id, corpus_number, file_path)`:**

  ```python

  def upload_file(api_key, customer_id, corpus_number, file_path):
    url = f"https://api.vectara.io/v1/upload?c={customer_id}&o={corpus_number}"

    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        files = {
            "file": (os.path.basename(file_path), f),
        }

        headers = {"Accept": "application/json", "x-api-key": api_key}

        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)

    return response.text


  ```

  - This function takes care of uploading your data to the newly created corpus in Vectara.
  - It requires four arguments:
    - `api_key`: Your Vectara API Key.
    - `customer_id`: Your Vectara customer ID.
    - `corpus_number`: The unique identifier for the corpus you created earlier.
    - `file_path`: The path to the data file you want to upload (obtained from `save_to_dir` or directly from your Streamlit app).
  - The function constructs a URL specific to uploading data to your corpus and uses the `requests` library to send a POST request with the data file.
  - The response from Vectara is returned by the function, potentially containing success or error messages.

**How these functions work together in a Streamlit App:**

Within your Streamlit app, you'll likely have components to:

1. **Collect user input:** This could involve text fields for the corpus name and description, or potentially an upload component for data files.
2. **Call `create_corpus`:** Once you have the necessary information, your Streamlit app will call the `create_corpus` function, passing your API key, customer ID, corpus details, and potentially handling the returned corpus number.
3. **(Optional) Call `save_to_dir`:** If your app involves user-uploaded files, you might use `save_to_dir` to temporarily store the file before uploading.
4. **Call `upload_file`:** With the corpus number and data file path (or data directly in memory), your app will call `upload_file` to send the data to your Vectara corpus.

By combining these functions with Streamlit's capabilities, you can create a user-friendly interface for corpus creation and data ingestion within your Vectara workflow.

## **Creating the `app.py` Script:**

**Building a Chatbot with Streamlit and Vectara**

This code creates a Streamlit application that allows you to:

1. **Set Up Your Vectara Connection:** Provide your Vectara API Key, Customer ID, and optionally upload additional training data for your chatbot.
2. **Interact with Your Chatbot:** Ask questions and receive responses powered by Vectara's AI capabilities.
3. **Automatic Corpus Update:** If the chatbot struggles to answer your question, the app automatically gathers relevant information and updates the corpus to improve future responses.

**Let's break down the code:**

**1. Setting Up the App (Imports and Configuration):**

```python
import os
import time
import json
import logging
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from datetime import datetime
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_chat import message
from injest import create_corpus, upload_file, save_to_dir

# Configure logging for better tracking
logging.basicConfig(format="\n%(asctime)s\n%(message)s", level=logging.INFO, force=True)

# Streamlit page configuration
st.set_page_config(page_title="Vectara Chat Essentials", page_icon="💬")
```

This section imports the necessary libraries and configures Streamlit for your app. Here's what each line does:

- **Imports:** These libraries handle various tasks like file handling, time tracking, data processing (JSON), logging errors, making API requests, web scraping, handling dates, building the Streamlit app interface, managing chat messages, and interacting with your custom `injest.py` module for corpus creation and data upload.
- **Logging:** This configures the app to log messages for easier debugging if any issues arise.
- **Streamlit Configuration:** Sets a title and icon for your app.

**2. Welcome Message and Introduction:**

```python
# Displaying the title with an emoji
st.title("Vectara Chat Essentials 🤖")

# Using markdown for a welcoming message with emojis for visual appeal
st.markdown("""
    Welcome to 'Vectara Chat Essentials: A Developer's Guide to Next-Gen Chatbots' 🌟.

    equipped with the latest in AI and conversational intelligence. 🧠💬
    Whether you are a beginner or an advanced developer, this guide will take you through all the steps
    from creating your first chatbot to deploying sophisticated AI-driven conversational agents.
    Let's embark on this exciting journey! 🚀
    """)

# Adding an interactive element

if st.button("Start Using Now!"):
    st.snow()
    st.write(
        "Great! Let's dive into the world of conversational AI with Vectara Chat. 🎉"
    )
```

This section creates an engaging introduction using Streamlit's features:

- **Title:** Sets the title of your app with an emoji.
- **Markdown:** Creates a formatted welcome message with emojis to make it visually appealing. You can customize this message to provide a more detailed introduction to your app and its functionalities.

**3. Connecting to Vectara (Sidebar):**

```python

# Ensure corpus_number is stored across sessions
if "corpus_number" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["corpus_number"] = None

# Sidebar setup for user inputs

with st.sidebar:
    st.session_state["vectara_api_key"] = st.text_input("Vectara API Key")
    st.session_state["serper_api_key"] = st.text_input("Serper API Key (for research)") # Optional
    vectara_customer_id = st.text_input("Vectara Customer ID")
    corpus_name = st.text_input("Corpus Name (optional)")
    corpus_description = st.text_input("Corpus Description (optional)")
    file = st.file_uploader("Upload a file (optional)", type=["text", "pdf"])

    if st.button("Submit") and file:
        corpus_number, _ = create_corpus(
            st.session_state["vectara_api_key"],
            vectara_customer_id,
            corpus_name,
            corpus_description,
        )

        if corpus_number is not None:
            st.session_state["corpus_number"] = corpus_number
            file_path = save_to_dir(file)
            upload_file(
                st.session_state["vectara_api_key"],
                vectara_customer_id,
                corpus_number,
                file_path,
            )
            st.success("File uploaded successfully!")
        else:
            st.error("Failed to create corpus. Please check your inputs.")
```

This section creates a sidebar where users can input their sensitive credentials

**4. Chat Functionality**

```python
# Chat message handling
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["messages"] = []

with st.form("chat_input", clear_on_submit=True):
    user_prompt = st.text_input("Your message:", label_visibility="collapsed")

    if st.form_submit_button("Send"):
        st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_prompt})
```

This section handles the core chat functionality of your app:

- **Message Storage:** The app uses Streamlit's session state to track chat history in the `st.session_state["messages"]` list. This ensures that the conversation is remembered across interactions.
- **Chat Input:** A form is created using `st.form` with a text input area (`st.text_input`) where users can type their messages. The "Send" button triggers the chat interaction.
- **Message Logic:** When the "Send" button is clicked, the user's message is added to the chat history with the role "user."

**5.Getting the conversation ID**

```python
def get_latest_conversation_id(api_key, customer_id):
    """Retrieves the latest conversation ID from Vectara."""
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.vectara.io/v1/list-conversations",
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "customer-id": customer_id,
            "x-api-key": api_key,
        },
        data=json.dumps({"numResults": 0, "pageKey": ""}),
    )
    response_data = response.json()
    return (
        response_data["conversation"][-1]["conversationId"]
        if response_data and "conversation" in response_data
        else None
    )
```

**Explanation:**

This function acts like a messenger, retrieving the latest conversation ID from your Vectara account. It does this by:

1. **Sending a request:** It uses the `requests` library to send a secure message to Vectara's API, providing your API key and customer ID for authentication.
2. **Specifying what you need:** The request tells Vectara you only need the latest conversation ID, not the entire history.
3. **Understanding the response:** The function analyzes Vectara's response and extracts the conversation ID if available.

This ID helps your app manage conversations and potentially learn from past interactions to improve the chatbot's responses over time.

**6.Getting the `research_and_update_corpus` function**

```python
def research_and_update_corpus(
    query, serper_api_key, vectara_api_key, vectara_customer_id, corpus_number
):
    """Conducts research and updates the corpus based on the query."""
    with st.status("Updating corpus...") as status:
        status.write("Sending request to Serper.dev API...")
        response = requests.post(
            "https://google.serper.dev/search",
            headers={"X-API-KEY": serper_api_key, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
            data=json.dumps({"q": query}),
        )

        search_results = json.loads(response.text)
        top_links = [result["link"] for result in search_results["organic"][:5]]

        consolidated_content = "\n".join(
            [fetch_url_content(link) for link in top_links]
        )
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
        file_path = os.path.join("", f"serper_response_{timestamp}.txt")

        with open(file_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
            file.write(consolidated_content)

        status.write("Uploading consolidated file to update corpus...")
        upload_response = upload_file(
            vectara_api_key, vectara_customer_id, corpus_number, file_path
        )
        status.update(label="Corpus updated successfully!", state="complete")
        time.sleep(1)

        return upload_response
```

**Explanation:**

This function helps your chatbot learn and improve! Here's what happens:

1. **User Asks a Question:** The chatbot encounters a user's question (provided as `query`) that it can't answer confidently.

2. **Updating Knowledge:** The function informs the user that the corpus is being updated ("Updating corpus..."). Then, it interacts with the Serper.dev API (like a search engine) to find relevant webpages based on the user's question.

3. **Gathering Information:** It extracts text content from the top search results using the `fetch_url_content` function (imagine a mini web researcher).

4. **Creating a Study Guide:** The function combines the collected text content into a single file. Think of this as a focused study guide tailored to the user's question.

5. **Enhancing the Corpus:** Finally, it uploads this study guide to your Vectara corpus (the chatbot's knowledge base) using the `upload_file` function (like adding information to a library). This strengthens the chatbot's knowledge and improves its ability to answer similar questions in the future.

**7.Getting the `fetch_url_content` function**

```python
def fetch_url_content(url):
    """Fetches content from a URL."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.text
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching {url}: {e}")
        return ""
```

**Explanation:**

This function acts like a personal assistant for your app. You give it a website address (URL), and it tries to fetch the text content from that webpage. Think of it as grabbing the information written on that page. If everything goes smoothly, the function brings back the text content. However, if there's a problem reaching the website, it logs the error for troubleshooting and returns an empty string, letting the app know it couldn't retrieve anything.

**8. Researching, Understanding, and Updating the Corpus**

```python

if user_prompt and st.session_state["vectara_api_key"]:
    conversation_id = get_latest_conversation_id(
        st.session_state["vectara_api_key"], vectara_customer_id
    )
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.vectara.io/v1/query",
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Accept": "application/json",
            "customer-id": vectara_customer_id,
            "x-api-key": st.session_state["vectara_api_key"],
        },
        data=json.dumps(
            {
                "query": [
                    {
                        "query": user_prompt,
                        "start": 0,
                        "numResults": 3,
                        "contextConfig": {
                            "sentences_before": 3,
                            "sentences_after": 3,
                            "start_tag": "<response>",
                            "end_tag": "</response>",
                        },
                        "corpusKey": [{"corpus_id": st.session_state["corpus_number"]}],
                        "summary": [
                            {"max_summarized_results": 3, "response_lang": "en"}
                        ],
                        "chat": {"store": True, "conversationId": conversation_id},
                    }
                ]
            }
        ),
    )
    query_response = response.json()

    if query_response["responseSet"] and query_response["responseSet"][0]["response"]:
        score = query_response["responseSet"][0]["response"][0]["score"]
        first_response = query_response["responseSet"][0]["summary"][0]["text"]

        if (
            score < 0.65
            or "The returned results did not contain sufficient information"
            in first_response
        ):
            st.write("Conversation paused. Updating corpus...")
            if st.session_state["corpus_number"] is not None:
                upload_response = research_and_update_corpus(
                    user_prompt,
                    st.session_state["serper_api_key"],
                    st.session_state["vectara_api_key"],
                    vectara_customer_id,
                    st.session_state["corpus_number"],
                )
                st.write(f"Corpus update response: {upload_response}")
            else:
                st.error("Corpus number is not set. Cannot update the corpus.")

        st.session_state.messages.append(
            {"role": "assistant", "content": first_response}
        )


```

This is the most complex part of the code, responsible for the clever self-improvement feature:

- **Vectara API interaction:** It sends the user's query to the Vectara API for a response.
- **Response Analysis:** The app checks the quality of the chatbot's response. If the score is low or the response indicates insufficient information, it triggers the corpus update process.
- **Research Update (`research_and_update_corpus`):**
  - Uses the Serper API to search for relevant information based on the user's query.
  - Fetches content from relevant search results.
  - Uploads the gathered information to your Vectara corpus to enhance the chatbot's knowledge.
- **Chat Display:** The chatbot's response is added to the chat history (with the role "assistant").
- **Message Display:** The `message` function from the `streamlit_chat` library is used to visually display the chat interaction within the app.

**Code:**

```python
# Display chat messages
for idx, msg in enumerate(st.session_state.messages):
    message(msg["content"], is_user=msg["role"] == "user", key=f"chat_message_{idx}")
```

**Explanation:**

Here's how it functions step-by-step:

1. **Retrieving Chat History:**

   - `st.session_state.messages`: This part references a list stored in Streamlit's session state, likely where your app keeps track of past chat messages (both user and chatbot).

2. **Looping Through Messages:**

   - `for idx, msg in enumerate(st.session_state.messages)`: This line sets up a loop to go through each message in the chat history.
     - `idx`: Provides an index number for each message, starting from 0.
     - `msg`: Represents an individual message object.

Run `streamlit run app.py` to view your app locally.

### **Deploying your Chatbot**

Great! Now that your Streamlit app is coming together, let's prepare it for hosting. We'll start by generating a `requirements.txt` file, check for the necessary Python files, and then push everything to GitHub. Here's how to do it:

### 1. Generate `requirements.txt`

This file lists all the Python packages your app depends on. You can generate it using `pip freeze`:

1. Activate your virtual environment (if you aren't already in it).
2. Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your terminal. This command creates a `requirements.txt` file with all installed packages and their versions.

### 2. Check Your Python Files

Ensure you have the following key files in your project directory:

- `app.py`: Your main Streamlit app file.
- `injest.py`: Contains functions for corpus creation, file upload, etc.
- `requirements.txt`: The file you just created with `pip freeze`.

### 3. Push Your Project to GitHub

Now, let's get your project onto GitHub:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository** (skip if you already have a Git repository):

   ```
   git init
   ```

2. **Add Your Files** to the staging area:

   ```
   git add app.py injest.py requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Commit Your Changes**:

   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Create a Repository on GitHub**:

   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   - Give it a name and an optional description.
   - Keep the repository public for Streamlit sharing.

5. **Link Your Local Repository to GitHub**:

   ```
   git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
   ```

6. **Push Your Code** to GitHub:

   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### 4. Deploy on Streamlit

1. **Go to Streamlit’s Community Cloud** and sign in.
2. **Create a New App**:
   - Click on “New app.”
   - Enter your GitHub repository details.
3. **Deploy Your App**:
   - Streamlit will automatically deploy your app and provide a URL.
4. **Share Your App**:
   - Use the URL to share your app with others.

Remember, whenever you make changes to your app and push them to GitHub, Streamlit will automatically update your deployed app.

That's it! Your Streamlit app is now live and shareable. For a more detailed explanation or any troubleshooting, check Streamlit’s [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io). Happy coding and sharing! 🎉👩‍💻🚀

#### Enhancing Chatbot Intelligence

<Img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d3Txh4w7/12.png" alt="Chatbot Self-Improvement" caption="A glimpse into the chatbot's self-improvement - updating itself for better accuracy." />

In this last snapshot of our Vectara Chat Essentials demo, you're observing the chatbot in a moment of self-improvement. The system notifies us that it's pausing the conversation to perform an update — this isn't just any update, though. It's a significant leap in the chatbot's ability to comprehend and communicate. Here's what's happening:

- The chatbot is demonstrating its unique capability to self-analyze and detect when its responses may not have the desired clarity or depth. This introspection is critical for a learning entity, and Vectara has engineered this into the heart of its platform.
- When the system detects a gap in its knowledge — perhaps triggered by a new query it struggled with or an emerging topic it hasn't encountered before — it doesn't just notify the user; it takes action. It autonomously searches for the relevant information, assimilates it, and enriches its corpus, the foundational database from which it crafts its responses.
- As we see the confirmation "Corpus updated successfully!" we're not just being informed of a completed task; we're being invited to witness the evolution of AI. The chatbot is becoming more informed, more adept at its task, and, as a result, more valuable to its user.
- The process of searching and updating isn't a static upload of data; it's an intelligent selection of what's necessary. The Vectara chatbot isn't merely increasing the quantity of its information; it's enhancing the quality of its intellect.
- The outcome is a smarter, sharper, and more sophisticated chatbot, ready to tackle more complex queries with a greater understanding of the nuances and context necessary for meaningful interaction.
