### Securing the Necessary API Keys and Tokens

To interact with the Trello API, you'll need to generate an API key and token. Follow these steps to obtain them:

1. **Generate an API Key**:

   - Create a Trello Power-Up if you haven't already. Refer to the [Managing Power-Ups documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/power-ups/publishing-and-managing-power-ups/) for guidance.
   - Visit the [Trello Power-Ups admin page](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin), access your Power-Up, navigate to the API Key tab, and select the option to generate a new API Key.

2. **Generate an API Token**:

   - On the same page where you found your API key, click the "Token" hyperlink next to the API key.
   - You will be prompted to authorize your app and generate a token. Click "Allow" to grant your app access to your Trello account.

   - Keep this token secret as it grants access to your Trello data.

For detailed information on generating API keys and tokens, refer to the [Trello API documentation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/).

### Securing the OpenAI API Key

To use the OpenAI functionalities within Synapse Copilot, you'll need to obtain an API key from OpenAI. Follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up for an OpenAI Account**:

   - Visit the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/).
   - Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one.

2. **Generate an API Key**:
   - Navigate to the API section of your OpenAI dashboard.
   - Click on the option to generate a new API key.
   - Copy the generated API key and keep it secure.

For more details, you can refer to the [OpenAI API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/).

### Configuring Your Project

Add your Trello API key, Trello token, and OpenAI API key to the `config.yml` file:

```yaml
openai_api_key: "your_openai_api_key"
trello_api_key: "your_trello_api_key"
trello_token: "your_trello_token"
```

### Running Synapse Copilot

To run Synapse Copilot and interact with your Trello boards, follow these steps to modify the `run.py` file and set it up to use environment variables for your API key and token.

#### Step 1: Modify the `run.py` File

Open the `run.py` file in your favorite code editor and navigate to the section related to the Trello scenario. You will see a block of commented code and an active code block.

#### Step 2: Update the Code for Environment Variables

Ensure that the active code block is correctly set up to use the API key and token from the environment variables defined in your `config.yml`. Below is the modified code block:

```python
elif scenario == "trello":
    os.environ["TRELLO_API_KEY"] = config["trello_api_key"]
    os.environ["TRELLO_TOKEN"] = config["trello_token"]

    key = os.environ["TRELLO_API_KEY"]
    token = os.environ["TRELLO_TOKEN"]

    replace_api_credentials_in_json(
        scenario=scenario,
        actual_key=key,
        actual_token=token,
    )
    api_spec, headers = process_spec_file(
        file_path="specs/trello_oas.json",
        token=token,
        key=key,
    )

    replace_api_credentials(
        model="api_selector",
        scenario=scenario,
        actual_key=key,
        actual_token=token,
    )
    replace_api_credentials(
        model="planner",
        scenario=scenario,
        actual_key=key,
        actual_token=token,
    )

    query_example = "Create a new board with name 'abc_board'"
```

This code sets the environment variables for the Trello API key and token from your `config.yml` file, eliminating the need to fetch them from a database. This approach simplifies the setup and enhances security.

#### Step 3: Run Synapse Copilot

With the `run.py` file updated, you can now run Synapse Copilot. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Navigate to the Synapse Copilot directory** if you are not already there:

   ```bash
   cd Synapse-Copilot
   ```

2. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:

   - Select the Trello scenario by typing `trello` and pressing Enter.
   - Enter the user ID (this can be any placeholder value since we are not using it in this setup).

Example interaction:

```plaintext
Please select a scenario (trello/jira/salesforce): trello
Enter the user id: 1
Example instruction: Create a new board with name 'abc_board'
Please input an instruction (Press ENTER to use the example instruction):
```

4. **Provide an instruction** or press Enter to use the example instruction provided:

   ```plaintext
   Query: Create a new board with name 'Health Planner'
   ```

The system will process the instruction and interact with the Trello API to create a new board named `Health Planner`.

By following these steps, you will have Synapse Copilot up and running, ready to manage your Trello boards efficiently. This powerful tool simplifies the process of working with APIs, allowing you to focus more on building and less on debugging.
