# **Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Video Generation with Allegro‚Äôs API**

## **Introduction üìπ**

Hello! Tommy here, and today I‚Äôm excited to introduce you to Allegro‚Äôs API for video generation by [Rhymes AI](https://lablab.ai/tech/rhymes-ai). This tutorial will walk you through setting up the API, making requests, and receiving high-quality video output‚Äîall in real time using Google Colab. I‚Äôll also provide a Colab notebook link so you can easily test the API hands-on.

Whether you‚Äôre curious about how text prompts can bring videos to life or looking to start your journey in automated video content creation, this tutorial will walk you through everything you need to get started while keeping it fun and accessible.

Let‚Äôs dive into the world of video generation! üé¨

## **Step 1: Setting Up Your API Token üîê**

Start by storing your Allegro API token securely in Google Colab by setting it as an environment variable.

```python
import os

# Store your API token as an environment variable
os.environ["ALLEGRO_API_KEY"] = "your_bearer_token_here"  # Replace with your actual token
```

## **Step 2: Creating a Video Task üé¨**

Next, create a video task with the following Python function. Note that Allegro‚Äôs API expects a refined prompt, the original user prompt, and several other parameters. Here‚Äôs the code to initiate the video generation task:

```python
import requests

def generate_video(token):
    url = "https://api.rhymes.ai/v1/generateVideoSyn"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "refined_prompt": "Handsome man running on the streets of Tokyo",
        "num_step": 50,
        "cfg_scale": 7.5,
        "user_prompt": "Handsome man running on the streets of Tokyo",
        "rand_seed": 42
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

# Fetch your API token from the environment variable
bearer_token = os.getenv("ALLEGRO_API_KEY")
response_data = generate_video(bearer_token)
print(response_data)
```

**Explanation of Parameters:**

- **refined_prompt**: A refined version of your initial prompt (must be at least 8 words).
- **num_step**: Defines the number of inference steps (default is 100 for quality).
- **cfg_scale**: Controls video quality (recommended default of 7.5).
- **rand_seed**: Ensures consistent output with the same seed value.
- **user_prompt**: Original prompt provided by the user.

Upon execution, you should see output like this:

```json
{
  "message": "ÊàêÂäü",
  "data": "data-value-from-creating-video-task",
  "status": 0
}
```

The `data` field provides the `requestId`, which you‚Äôll use to track the status of your video task.

### Using `curl` for Command-Line Users

For users who prefer the command line, here‚Äôs how you can create the video task using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.rhymes.ai/v1/generateVideoSyn" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_allegro_api_token_here" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "refined_prompt": "Handsome man running on the streets of Tokyo",
    "num_step": 50,
    "cfg_scale": 7.5,
    "user_prompt": "Handsome man running on the streets of Tokyo",
    "rand_seed": 42
}'
```

Replace `"your_allegro_api_token_here"` with your actual API token.

## **Step 3: Querying the Video Task Status ‚è≥**

Wait at least two minutes before querying the task status, as the video processing may take some time. Here‚Äôs the code to check whether the video is ready:

```python
import requests

def query_video_status(token, request_id):
    url = "https://api.rhymes.ai/v1/videoQuery"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    }
    params = {
        "requestId": request_id
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

# Replace with the request ID from the previous step
request_id = "data-value-from-creating-video-task"
response_data = query_video_status(bearer_token, request_id)
print(response_data)
```

The output will include a link to the video in the `data` field if it‚Äôs ready:

```json
{
  "message": "ÊàêÂäü",
  "data": "link-to-generated-video",
  "status": 0
}
```

If the video is not yet ready, you‚Äôll see:

```json
{
  "message": "ÊàêÂäü",
  "data": "",
  "status": 0
}
```

#### **Using `curl` for Command-Line Users**

To check the status of your video task via `curl`, use the following:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.rhymes.ai/v1/videoQuery?requestId=data-value-from-creating-video-task" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your_allegro_api_token_here"
```

Replace `your_bearer_token_here` and `data-value-from-creating-video-task` with your actual values. If the video is ready, the `data` field will contain a link to the video file stored on an S3 bucket. If not, it will return an empty `data` field.

Using these `curl` commands, you can create and track video tasks directly from your terminal, making Allegro‚Äôs API accessible for command-line automation or testing.
