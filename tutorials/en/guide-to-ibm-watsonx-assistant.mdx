## IBM Cloud account usage tips

**General:**

- Collaborate with other participants to form a team and leverage your team
  members’ cloud accounts to utilize the resources effectively.
- Always save your work in regular intervals.

**watsonx.ai:**
If you have integrated watsonx.ai to enable generative AI capabilities for
your watsonx Assistant, the watsonx.ai service consumes resources by
tokens for using the foundational models available on the platform. A token
is a collection of characters that has semantic meaning for a model.
Tokenization is the process of converting the words in your prompt into
tokens. You can learn more about tokens and how they are calculated [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-tokens.html?context=wx&audience=wdp).

Leverage the model parameters to set limits for token consumption and
repetitions for efficient prompting. You can learn how to work with model
parameters [here](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-model-parameters.html?context=wx&audience=wdp&audience=wdp).

**Note:** The focus of this hackathon is watsonx Assistant and NOT watsonx.ai.
watsonx.ai must be used only for enabling the generative AI capabilities for
your assistant and not for any other purpose. Your cloud account will be
deactivated if any suspicious watsonx.ai service utilization is noticed.
