## **Step 3: Planning Your Assistant**

With your initial setup complete, it’s time to think strategically. Planning your assistant will help you build a solution that aligns with your goals and user needs.To better understand how to effectively plan your assistant, refer to [this guide](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-plan-assistant).

Proper planning is essential to ensure that your assistant is well-structured and meets its intended goals. Here’s how to start: Before building your assistant, plan out:

- **Initial Channel Selection**: Decide which platform or channel your assistant will operate on.
- **Domain Expertise**: Choose the primary focus (e.g., customer support, HR).
- **Tone and Language**: Set the communication style.
- **Content Source Integration**: Identify relevant content sources.
- **Handoff Strategy**: Plan how interactions will transfer to human agents if needed.

## **Step 4: Building Actions and Steps**

Once you have a plan in place, it’s time to start constructing your assistant by creating actions and steps. These form the foundation of your assistant’s interactions.

Creating actions and steps is critical to constructing a robust conversation flow. Follow these guidelines to build effectively:

- **What is an Action?**: A task or problem the assistant helps resolve, like paying a bill or tracking orders.
  <Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqvd8otcz/image/upload/v1731558287/st4-1_q5nnfn.png" alt="Action diagram" caption="Action diagram" />
- **What is a Step?**: An interaction between the assistant and user, including clarification questions, final responses, and agent handoffs.

### **Example Exercise:**

### **Building a Billing Use Case**

1. **Create Your First Action**:

   - On your assistant's home page, select **Actions** from the left navigation panel.
