# No-Code phi3 Fine-Tuning: A Hands-On Guide Using LlamaFactory

## Introduction

Hello!üëãüèΩ I'm Tommy, and today I'm excited to show you how to fine-tune the powerful **Phi3** model without writing any code. Whether you're a software developer, AI enthusiast, or just someone curious about machine learning, this tutorial will guide you through the process using the intuitive **LlamaFactory** interface.

Fine-tuning models like **Phi3** might seem complex, but with LlamaFactory, it's straightforward and accessible. In just a few steps, you'll be able to customize **Phi3** to fit your specific needs, all through a simple, no-code platform. Let's get started and unleash the potential of AI together!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

* A Google account to access Google Colab  
* Basic understanding of LLMs and fine-tuning concepts  
* Familiarity with Hugging Face (optional, for model export)

## Setting Up the Environment

### Google Colab

To get started, open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and create a new notebook. Make sure to enable GPU support for faster training. You can do this by navigating to `Edit` > `Notebook settings` and selecting T4 GPU as the hardware accelerator. Ensure you select **T4 GPU** for optimal performance.

### Installing Dependencies

Run the following commands in your Google Colab notebook to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash  
%cd /content/  
%rm -rf LLaMA-Factory  
!git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git  
%cd LLaMA-Factory  
%ls  
!pip install "unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git"  
!pip install --no-deps "xformers<0.0.27" "trl<0.9.0" peft accelerate  
!pip install .[bitsandbytes]
```

Check  environment to ensure that a GPU is connected:

```bash
import torch  
try:  
 assert torch.cuda.is_available() is True  
except AssertionError:  
 print("Please set up a GPU before using LLaMA Factory‚Äù)
```

## Adding Your Own Dataset to LlamaFactory

To customize the phi3 model with your own data, you'll need to add your dataset to LlamaFactory. Here's how you can do it, whether your data is stored locally or on the Hugging Face Hub.

1. **Navigate to the Data Folder**:  
   * In the LlamaFactory repository, locate and open the **LLaMa-Factory > data** directory.  
   * This is where you'll define and initialize your datasets for use within the LlamaFactory UI.  
2. **Adding a Local Dataset**:  
   - If you have a dataset stored locally, save it in the **data** folder. The file should be named in a format like `name-of-dataset.json`.  
   * Next, open the `dataset_info.json` file within the same **data** folder.  
   * Add an entry for your dataset using the following format:

```json
"name-for-the-dataset": {
    "file_name": "name-of-dataset.json"
}
```

3.  **Adding a Dataset from the Hugging Face Hub**:  
    * If your dataset is hosted remotely on the Hugging Face Hub, you can also link it through the `dataset_info.json` file.  
    * Add an entry for your dataset with the following format:

```json
"name-for-the-dataset": {
    "hf_hub_url": "dataset-path-from-hub",
    "ms_hub_url": "dataset-path-from-hub"
}
```

4. **Initialize Your Dataset**:  
   * Once you‚Äôve added your dataset to `dataset_info.json`, it will be initialized and available for selection within the LlamaFactory UI.

## Start the LlamaFactory Web UI

After installing the necessary dependencies, run the code snippet below to start the LlamaFactory web UI

```bash
%cd /content/LLaMA-Factory/  
!GRADIO_SHARE=True llamafactory-cli webui
```

A public url will be generated after running the snippet above. Click the url to get into the llamafactory interface, where we will fine tuning our Phi3 model

## Fine Tuning the Phi3 Model

Upon opening the Public URL, you'll find several sections. We wiil go through the steps to start training our Phi3 model.

### Step 1: Select the Phi3 Model

Click on the dropdown in **Model Name** and select the **Phi3-4b-4k-Chat** model. The model path automatically updates when the Model Name is selected.

### Step 2: Setup Advanced Configurations

In this section, select **4** from the **Quantization bit** dropdown, the **Quantization method** as bitsandbytes and prompt template should be **phi.**   
For the booster, Set this to `Unsloth` for efficient training. However, if you encounter issues during testing, switch this to `Auto`.


<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqvd8otcz/image/upload/v1723819052/advanced_config_lyp4jq.png" alt="Advanced Configuration" caption="Set Advanced Configuration" />

### Step 3: Configure the Train Section

Next, click on the **Dataset** dropdown and select the dataset of your choice or the one you added. In this case, **alpaca_gpt4_en** is selected to be used to fine tune the Phi3 model.

Enusre the selections in the red rectangles tallies with yours. You can also feel free to change any parameter/selection.

### Step 4: Setup LoRA Configuration

Set the **LoRA Rank** to a higher rank if you're using smaller models like `Phi3` - In my case, I set the rank to 64, but feel free to experiment based on your specific use case.

### Step 5: Start the Training Process

You can change the **Output dir** and the **Config path** which store the training checkpoints and saving argument respectively.

Click on Start to kick off the training process. The training lasted for approximately 20 mins before finish. During training, a line graph of the loss to step is shown to give us insight on our Phi3 model being fine tuned.

## Testing the Fine Tuned Phi3 Model

Now that our model has been successfully fine tuned, it is time to test the model. Follow the steps below to test the fine tuned model:

### Step 1: Update Checkpoint Path

Under **Checkpoint Path** select the **output dir** name earlier ‚Äú**train_phi3**‚Äù and click on the chat sub section.

### Step 2: Load the Fine Tuned Model

With the Defaults untouched, Click on **Load Model** to begin testing the fine tuned model. This might take 2-5minutes to load depending on the GPU in use.

### Step 3: Test the Fine Tuned Model

After the model has been loaded, you can test your model with different prompts and gauge if the response suits your taste or not.

## Exporting the Fine Tuned Phi3 Model

Haing tested the Fine tuned model, you can export it either locally or remotely to huggingface hub. Select the **Expor**t sub section beside **Chat** to start the export process.

Change the name of the **Export dir** to where you want the model to be saved locally. To save the model to the hub, add your HuggingFace Hub ID to **HF Hub ID**

Click on **Export** to start the process  

<Img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqvd8otcz/image/upload/v1723819058/export_model_xtafxd.png" alt="Export Model" caption="Export the tested Model" />

Once the Export is complete, you can find the model in **LLaMa-Factory > saves > Phi3-4B-4k-Chat > lora**

## Practical Tips

1. **Start Small**:  
   * Begin with a smaller subset of your dataset for initial fine-tuning. This allows you to quickly test and iterate on configurations without long wait times.  
2. **Optimize LoRA Rank**:  
   * For smaller models like phi3, experiment with higher LoRA ranks. A LoRA rank of 64 worked well during testing, but feel free to adjust based on your dataset size and GPU capacity.  
3. **Use T4 GPU Wisely**:  
   * Leverage the T4 GPU‚Äôs 16 GB memory efficiently by adjusting batch size and learning rate to prevent out-of-memory errors. Monitor your GPU usage to optimize performance.  
4. **Booster Settings**:  
   * Use `Unsloth` for training to maximize speed and efficiency. However, if you encounter issues while testing, switch to `Auto` to ensure smooth operation.  
5. **Dataset Integration**:  
   * When adding your dataset, double-check the format in `dataset_info.json` to ensure it appears correctly in the LlamaFactory UI. Consistent naming and paths are key to avoiding integration errors.

## Conclusion

Great job! You‚Äôve successfully fine-tuned the **phi3** model using LlamaFactory‚Äôs no-code interface. From adding your dataset and training the model, to testing and exporting it, you've mastered each step. Now, you can harness the power of a customized **phi3** model tailored to your specific needs.
