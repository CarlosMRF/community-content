# Designing the Tasks

With a solid understanding of what **LLaMA 3.1** and **Mistral 2 Large** bring to the table, it's time to design the tasks that will allow us to compare these models in action. The tasks we'll be using are carefully chosen to reflect common applications in synthetic data generation, providing a well-rounded view of each model's strengths and weaknesses.

### Task 1: Email Creation

- **Scenario**: Imagine you need to generate a series of professional emails based on different contexts—such as replying to a client, scheduling a meeting, or providing a project update. The goal here is to see how well each model can craft clear, coherent, and contextually appropriate emails.
- **What We're Testing**: This task will test the models' abilities to understand context and generate text that is not only accurate but also suitable for the professional tone typically required in email communication.
- **Why It Matters**: In the real world, businesses often use AI to draft or suggest email content. The ability to generate emails that are contextually relevant and require minimal editing can save significant time and resources.

### Task 2: Text Summarization

- **Scenario**: Suppose you have a lengthy article or document that you need to summarize quickly. The task for the models is to condense this information into a concise summary while preserving the key points and overall meaning.
- **What We're Testing**: Here, we're focusing on how well the models can extract and compress information. This task will reveal which model is better at understanding and summarizing large volumes of text efficiently.
- **Why It Matters**: Summarization is crucial in many fields, from journalism to legal research, where professionals need to process large amounts of information quickly and accurately.

### Task 3: Text Classification

- **Scenario**: Imagine you need to classify a batch of customer feedback into categories like "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral." The task is to see how accurately each model can categorize the text based on its content.
- **What We're Testing**: This task evaluates the models' ability to understand nuances in text and correctly assign categories. It's a test of precision and contextual understanding, particularly in how well the models can differentiate between subtly different sentiments or topics.
- **Why It Matters**: Text classification is a common task in natural language processing, particularly in areas like sentiment analysis, spam detection, and content moderation. Accurate classification can significantly enhance decision-making processes.

### Why These Tasks?

These tasks are representative of real-world scenarios where synthetic data generation is invaluable. They provide a comprehensive test of each model's capabilities, from generating content to processing and interpreting existing text. By using these varied tasks, we'll be able to see not just which model performs better overall, but how each model excels in specific contexts.

In the next section, we'll dive into the **Execution** of these tasks, where I'll guide you through the Python code that orchestrates the comparison. We'll explore how to run these tasks, gather the outputs, and prepare the data for analysis.

# Executing the Comparison

With our tasks clearly defined, it's time to execute them using the **LLaMA 3.1** and **Mistral 2 Large** models. This section will guide you through the process, focusing on how to run the tasks, collect the outputs, and prepare the results for analysis. We'll break down the key parts of the Python script (`compare.py`) that orchestrates this comparison.

---

# Overview of the Python Script


## 0. Setting Up the Environment

Before we begin, let's create and activate a virtual environment to keep our project dependencies isolated.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install openai python-dotenv requests numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```


## 1. Setting Up the API Connections

The first step in the script is to configure the API connections for both models. This ensures that we can send our tasks to the models and receive their outputs.

```python
import openai
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

# Set up API keys
openai.api_key = os.getenv('NVIDIA_API_KEY')

# Define the models
LLAMA_MODEL = "meta/llama-3.1-405b-instruct"
MISTRAL_MODEL = "mistralai/mistral-large-2-instruct"
```

Here, we load the API keys from our `.env` file and specify the models we'll be using. This configuration allows us to switch between models easily when running the tasks.

## 2. Running the Tasks

For each task, the script sends a prompt to both **LLaMA 3.1** and **Mistral 2 Large**, capturing their responses. This is done in a loop to process multiple prompts if needed.

```python
def run_task(prompt, model):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model=model,
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=500
    )
    return response.choices[0].text

# Example prompt for email creation
prompt = "Write a professional email to a client, informing them of a project delay."

# Run the task for both models
response_llama = run_task(prompt, LLAMA_MODEL)
response_mistral = run_task(prompt, MISTRAL_MODEL)
```

This function sends the prompt to the specified model and returns the generated text. The example provided is for an email creation task, but similar functions are used for summarization and classification.

## 3. Measuring Performance

Performance metrics are crucial for understanding how well each model handles the tasks. The script captures several key metrics, including execution time and tokens per second, to evaluate efficiency.

```python
import time

def measure_performance(model, prompt):
    start_time = time.time()
    response = run_task(prompt, model)
    end_time = time.time()

    execution_time = end_time - start_time
    tokens = len(response.split())
    tokens_per_second = tokens / execution_time

    return execution_time, tokens_per_second
```

This function measures how long it takes for a model to generate a response and calculates the number of tokens processed per second. These metrics help compare the speed and efficiency of the two models.

## 4. Evaluating the Outputs

Beyond raw performance, the quality of the output is also evaluated using metrics like **BLEU**, **METEOR**, and **ROUGE** scores. These scores assess how closely the generated text matches expected results, which is particularly important for tasks like summarization.

```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu, SmoothingFunction
from rouge import Rouge

def evaluate_output(reference, generated):
    # BLEU Score
    smoothie = SmoothingFunction().method4
    bleu_score = sentence_bleu([reference.split()], generated.split(), smoothing_function=smoothie)
    
    # ROUGE Score
    rouge = Rouge()
    rouge_scores = rouge.get_scores(generated, reference)

    return bleu_score, rouge_scores
```

Here, we use `sentence_bleu` from NLTK and `Rouge` to calculate the BLEU and ROUGE scores, respectively. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and relevance of the generated text compared to a reference output.

## 5. Logging and Displaying Results

The script also logs the results and displays them in a readable format, often using the `rich` library for better visualization.

```python
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table

def display_results(llama_results, mistral_results):
    console = Console()
    table = Table(title="Model Comparison Results")

    table.add_column("Metric", justify="right", style="cyan")
    table.add_column("LLaMA 3.1", style="magenta")
    table.add_column("Mistral 2 Large", style="green")

    for metric in llama_results.keys():
        table.add_row(metric, str(llama_results[metric]), str(mistral_results[metric]))

    console.print(table)
```

This function creates a table that compares the performance and output quality of both models side by side, making it easy to interpret the results.

## Putting It All Together

By combining these functions, the script automates the entire process—from running the tasks to evaluating the results. Here's a simplified version of how you might execute a complete comparison:

```python
# Example task
prompt = "Summarize the following article about AI advancements."

# Run tasks and measure performance
llama_time, llama_speed = measure_performance(LLAMA_MODEL, prompt)
mistral_time, mistral_speed = measure_performance(MISTRAL_MODEL, prompt)

# Evaluate outputs (assuming we have a reference summary)
reference_summary = "AI advancements are transforming industries by enabling new technologies."
llama_bleu, llama_rouge = evaluate_output(reference_summary, response_llama)
mistral_bleu, mistral_rouge = evaluate_output(reference_summary, response_mistral)

# Log results
llama_results = {
    "Execution Time": llama_time, 
    "Tokens per Second": llama_speed, 
    "BLEU Score": llama_bleu, 
    "ROUGE Score": llama_rouge
}
mistral_results = {
    "Execution Time": mistral_time, 
    "Tokens per Second": mistral_speed, 
    "BLEU Score": mistral_bleu, 
    "ROUGE Score": mistral_rouge
}

# Display results
display_results(llama_results, mistral_results)
```

# Measuring and Analyzing Performance

To comprehensively evaluate the performance of **LLaMA 3.1** and **Mistral 2 Large**, we conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses. This approach ensures that we don't just measure how fast or efficient a model is, but also assess the quality and coherence of the text it generates.

## Quantitative Results

The quantitative analysis focuses on the execution efficiency of each model. Here, we measured two key metrics: **Execution Time** and **Tokens per Second**.

| Metric             | LLaMA 3.1 | Mistral 2 Large |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Execution Time** | 22.26s    | 18.48s          |
| **Tokens per Second** | 12.76     | 27.55           |

- **Execution Time**: This measures how long it takes for each model to generate a response after receiving a prompt. Mistral 2 Large is faster, completing tasks in 18.48 seconds compared to LLaMA 3.1's 22.26 seconds. This makes Mistral more suitable for scenarios where speed is a priority.
- **Tokens per Second**: This metric indicates how many tokens (words or word segments) the model processes each second. Mistral 2 Large processes more than double the tokens per second compared to LLaMA 3.1, reinforcing its efficiency advantage.

## Qualitative Results (Nemotron Scores)

While quantitative metrics tell us how fast a model works, qualitative analysis reveals how well the models understand and generate text. For this, we used the **Nemotron-4 340B** model, which evaluates the generated text on several dimensions: **Helpfulness, Correctness, Coherence, and Complexity**.

| Metric            | LLaMA 3.1 | Mistral 2 Large |
|-------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Helpfulness**   | 3.77      | 4.00            |
| **Correctness**   | 3.80      | 4.06            |
| **Coherence**     | 3.84      | 3.80            |
| **Complexity**    | 2.50      | 2.81            |

- **Helpfulness**: This score reflects how useful the generated text is in answering a query or completing a task. Mistral 2 Large scored slightly higher (4.00) than LLaMA 3.1 (3.77), indicating that it produces more immediately actionable or relevant responses.
- **Correctness**: Correctness measures the accuracy of the content generated by the models. Mistral 2 Large again scores higher (4.06), suggesting it produces fewer factual errors or misinterpretations than LLaMA 3.1 (3.80).
- **Coherence**: Coherence evaluates how logically connected and consistent the text is. LLaMA 3.1 scores slightly better (3.84) than Mistral 2 Large (3.80), showing that LLaMA might produce more fluid and logically consistent narratives.
- **Complexity**: This metric assesses how complex or sophisticated the generated text is. Mistral 2 Large (2.81) produces slightly more complex text than LLaMA 3.1 (2.50), which could be beneficial in tasks requiring detailed explanations or nuanced responses.

### Why Nemotron-4?

The Nemotron-4 340B model was chosen for qualitative evaluation because it provides a human-like judgment on the generated text. While quantitative metrics are essential for measuring efficiency, they don't capture the nuances of language quality—such as whether a response is helpful or coherent. Nemotron-4 fills this gap by evaluating text across several dimensions, offering a more holistic view of each model's capabilities.

## Analysis and Implications

The results from both quantitative and qualitative analyses provide valuable insights:

### Efficiency vs. Quality

- **Mistral 2 Large** is clearly the faster model, with better efficiency metrics like execution time and tokens per second. However, when it comes to the quality of the text—especially in areas like coherence—**LLaMA 3.1** holds its ground, suggesting it might be better for tasks where the quality and consistency of the narrative are crucial.

### Task-Specific Strengths

Depending on your needs, you might prefer one model over the other:

- If your task requires quick responses without compromising too much on correctness, **Mistral 2 Large** is likely the better choice.
- Conversely, if your task demands more complex and coherent text, **LLaMA 3.1** might be more suitable.

These findings help paint a clearer picture of which model might be more appropriate for specific use cases, allowing you to make informed decisions based on your project's priorities.
