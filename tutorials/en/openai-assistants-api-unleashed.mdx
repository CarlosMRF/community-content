<Img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nVdgbcrY/Key-Steps.png" alt="key Components" caption="Key components" />

#### 1. Creating an Assistant
Start by defining an Assistant in the API. This involves setting up custom instructions and choosing a suitable model.
#### 2. Initiating a Conversation Thread
When a user starts a conversation, a Thread is created. Threads maintain the state of the conversation, allowing for context-aware interactions and continuity in dialogue.
#### 3. Adding Messages to the Thread
As the conversation progresses, Messages are added to the Thread. These can be queries, commands, or responses.
#### 4. Adding Messages to the Thread
To generate responses, the Assistant is 'run' on the Thread, where it processes the Messages and utilizes relevant tools.
#### 5. Retrieving and Displaying Responses
Once the Assistant has processed the Messages, its responses are retrieved and displayed to the user.

For a more detailed explanation of each step and to explore the full capabilities of the Assistants API, including its intricate mechanics and advanced features, please refer to the [OpenAI Assistants API - How It Works](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works) documentation. This resource provides comprehensive insights and guidance, making it an invaluable tool for both new and experienced users of the API.



### Implementing AI Financial Analyst Using Assistance API

This demo app is created to demonstrate the abilities and usefulness of the assistance API.

### Import Necessary Libraries

Before we dive into the implementation details, it's important to import all the necessary libraries that our application will require. This includes libraries for basic file and time handling, the OpenAI API, and Streamlit for building our application interface. Add the following import statements at the beginning of your Python script:

```python
import os
import time
import openai
import streamlit as st
```

### Step 1: Installing Dependencies and Setting Up OpenAI API Key
To get started, you'll need to install the latest version of the OpenAI package. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to ensure you have the most up-to-date package:

```bash
!pip install --upgrade openai
```
Obtain OpenAI API Key, If you don’t have an OpenAI API key, visit the OpenAI Developer Portal.
Sign up and request an API key.
Securely store your API key for future use.

```python
OPENAI_KEY="sk-xxxx" #Your OpenAI API Key 
```
Or can Create a function ```initialize_openai_client(api_key)``` that initializes the OpenAI client with the provided API key.

```python
def initialize_openai_client(api_key):
    return openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
```

The ```initialize_openai_client``` function initializes an OpenAI client using a provided API key, allowing the application to access OpenAI's services.

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Assistant
The setup process for an Assistant is straightforward. You'll need to define several key aspects:
- **Name** :Assign a name to your assistant.
- **Instructions** : Provide specific instructions that your Assistant will follow.
- **Tools** : Choose the tools for your Assistant. For this example, we'll use the Retrieval and Code Interpreter tools.
- **Model Name** : Select the AI model you wish to use

Here's how you can do it in python:


```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)

assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name = "Finance Insight Analyst",
    instructions = "You are a helpful  financial analyst expert and, focusing on management discussions and financial results. help people learn about financial needs and guid them towards fincial literacy.",
    tools = [{"type":"code_interpreter"}, {"type": "retrieval"}],
    model = "gpt-4-1106-preview"
)
```
Once you’ve done this, your Assistant is created! Let’s have a look.
```python
import json

def show_json(obj):
    print(json.dumps(json.loads(obj.model_dump_json()), indent=4))

show_json(assistant)
```
This will print all the information about the assistant but the most important information is the Assistant ID.

#### Creating a New Assistant via the OpenAI Dashboard
Another method to create a new assistant is by using the OpenAI Dashboard, which provides a user-friendly interface for this purpose.

<Img src="https://i.postimg.cc/cL3CKLbf/Screenshot-2023-12-04-at-8-25-29-PM.png" alt="key Components" caption="Key components" />

In the OpenAI Dashboard, you can easily select the necessary tools and the AI model for your assistant. The process involves specifying clear instructions for your assistant’s operation and adding reference files as needed. This approach is particularly useful for those who prefer a more visual and interactive setup experience compared to coding.

### Step 3: Creating a Thread for Conversation
In this step, we start a Thread which acts as a holder for the ongoing dialogue between a user and the Assistant. This approach is different from the earlier ChatCompletion API, as it doesn’t require resending the full conversation history for every interaction.

```python
thread = client.beta.threads.create()
```
With the OpenAI Assistants API, it's feasible to create multiple threads for the same type of action, allowing simultaneous handling of various interactions or conversations, each in their unique context, thereby enhancing the capability to manage parallel dialogues or tasks efficiently within the same application

### Step 4: Managing Messages and Running the Assistant
The following steps are consolidated to manage the conversation:

#### 1. Adding Messages to the Thread:
- The conversation message is added to the thread
- This is done to ensure that the Assistant has all the necessary context for the conversation.

#### 2. Running the Assistant on the Thread:
- This process automatically activates the relevant tools the Assistant might need.
- Triggering the Assistant on the Thread initiates its response

Creating a Run is an asynchronous operation. Initially, the Run’s metadata is returned with a status of “queued.” The status updates as the Assistant uses tools and adds messages. To effectively manage this asynchronous nature, we define several functions:


In building an application with the OpenAI Assistants API, it's crucial to have a structured approach to handle user interactions efficiently. To facilitate this, we define key functions: ``submit_message``, ``wait_on_run``, and ``get_response``. Each of these functions plays a vital role in streamlining the interaction flow.

The ``submit_message`` function is designed to add a new user message to a specific thread and subsequently initiate the Assistant on that thread for processing the message.

```python
def submit_message(assistant_id, thread, user_message):
    client.beta.threads.messages.create(
        thread_id=thread.id, role="user", content=user_message
    )
    return client.beta.threads.runs.create(
        thread_id=thread.id,
        assistant_id=assistant_id,
    )
```

The ``wait_on_run`` function continuously tracks the status of a Run to determine when the Assistant has completed processing the request.
```python
import time

def wait_on_run(run, thread):
    while run.status == "queued" or run.status == "in_progress":
        run = client.beta.threads.runs.retrieve(
            thread_id=thread.id,
            run_id=run.id,
        )
        time.sleep(0.5)
    return run
```

The ``get_response`` function is tasked with fetching the response from a thread after the completion of a Run.
```python
def get_response(thread):
    return client.beta.threads.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id, order="asc")
```
These functions streamline the process of managing the conversation, submitting queries, and retrieving responses from the OpenAI Assistant.

### Step 5 : Enhanced Response Clarity

The ``pretty`` function is an integral component of our application, specifically tailored to enhance the readability and presentation of the responses generated by the OpenAI Assistant.

```python
def pretty_print(messages):
    responses = []
    for m in messages:
        if m.role == "assistant":
            responses.append(m.content[0].text.value)
    return "\n".join(responses)
```

### Step 6: Configuring the Streamlit User Interface

In this step, we'll set up the Streamlit User Interface (UI) for our application, which includes configuring the sidebar for API key input and creating options to select between different assistants.

```python
# Streamlit UI for sidebar configuration
st.sidebar.title("Configuration")
entered_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter your OpenAI API key", type="password")

# Check if an API key is entered, then initialize the OpenAI client
client = None
if entered_api_key:
    with st.spinner('Initializing OpenAI Client...'):
        client = initialize_openai_client(entered_api_key)

# Sidebar for selecting the assistant
assistant_option = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Select an Assistant",
    ("Financial Assistant", "PDF Analyzer")
)
```
Sidebar Configuration for API Key Entry

1. Title Setup:   
  - Use ``st.sidebar.title("Configuration")`` to add a title to the sidebar, guiding users to the configuration section.

2. API Key Input:

Implement ``entered_api_key = st.sidebar.text_input("Enter your OpenAI API key", type="password")`` to create a password-type input field where users can securely enter their OpenAI API key.


#### **Initializing the OpenAI Client**

3. Client Setup:
- Check if an API key has been entered. If so, use ``initialize_openai_client(entered_api_key)`` within a loading spinner context to initialize the OpenAI client.

#### **Assistant Selection via Sidebar**
4. Assistant Options:
Create a selection box with ``assistant_option = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select an Assistant", ("Financial Assistant", "PDF Analyzer"))`` for users to choose the type of assistant they want to interact with.

### Step 7: Implementing Financial Assistant Functionality

This step involves integrating the Financial Assistant feature into our Streamlit application. We'll set up a user-friendly interface and process user queries to provide financial insights using the OpenAI Assistants API.

```python
if assistant_option == "Financial Assistant":
    st.title("Financial Assistants :bar_chart:")

    # Description
    st.markdown("""
        This assistant is your go-to resource for financial insights and advice. Here's what you can do:
        - :page_facing_up: **Analyze financial statements** to understand your company's health.
        - :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Track market trends** and make informed investment decisions.
        - :moneybag: Receive tailored **investment advice** to maximize your portfolio's performance.
        - :bulb: **Explore various financial scenarios** and plan strategically for future ventures.

        Simply enter your financial query below and let the assistant guide you with actionable insights.
    """)
    user_query = st.text_input("Enter your financial query:")

    if st.button('Get Financial Insight') and client:
        with st.spinner('Fetching your financial insights...'):
            thread = client.beta.threads.create()
            run = submit_message("asst_PWxRJ5oOqEHx0CisVEBpFgKI", thread, user_query)
            run = wait_on_run(run, thread)
            response_messages = get_response(thread)
            response = pretty_print(response_messages)
            st.text_area("Response:", value=response, height=300)
```

#### **UI Setup for Financial Assistant**
1. Display Interface:
- When the user selects ``"Financial Assistant"`` from the sidebar, the application will dynamically update to show the relevant interface for this functionality.
- We'll use ``st.title`` to display a prominent title for this section of the app, such as "Financial Assistants :bar_chart:".
- A descriptive section will be added using st.markdown, explaining the capabilities of the Financial Assistant.

#### **Query Input and Processing**
1. Input Field for Queries:
- We provide an input field using ``st.text_input`` where users can type in their financial queries. This could be anything from specific questions about financial data to requests for market analysis.
2. Processing Queries:
- Upon user input, the application uses the ``submit_message`` function to send the query to the OpenAI Assistant within a created thread.
- The ``wait_on_run`` function is then used to monitor the processing of the query, ensuring that the application waits until the Assistant has fully processed the request.
- Once processing is complete, ``get_response`` fetches the responses from the thread.
- Finally, the ``pretty_print`` function formats these responses for clear and readable output to the user.
3. Displaying Responses:
- The processed and formatted responses from the Financial Assistant are displayed on the Streamlit app interface, providing users with the requested financial insights.


### Step 8: Implementing PDF Analyzer Functionality
In this step, we integrate the PDF Analyzer into our Streamlit application. This functionality allows users to upload PDF documents and receive insights or specific information extracted by the OpenAI Assistant.

```python
elif assistant_option == "PDF Analyzer":
    st.title("PDF Analyzer  :mag:")

    # Description for PDF Analyzer
    st.markdown("""
        Use this tool to extract valuable information from PDF documents. Ideal for:
        - :page_facing_up: **Analyzing text and data** within PDFs for research or business insights.
        - :mag_right: **Extracting specific information** from large documents quickly.
        - :clipboard: Converting **PDF content into actionable data** to inform decision-making.
        - :bookmark_tabs: Gaining insights from **financial reports, research papers, or legal documents** in PDF format.

        Upload a PDF file and enter your specific query related to the document.
    """)

    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a PDF file", type=["pdf"])
    user_query = st.text_input("Enter your query about the PDF:")

    if uploaded_file is not None and user_query:
        with st.spinner('Analyzing PDF...'):
            temp_dir = "temp"
            if not os.path.exists(temp_dir):
                os.makedirs(temp_dir)

            temp_file_path = os.path.join(temp_dir, uploaded_file.name)
            with open(temp_file_path, "wb") as f:
                f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())

            try:
                file_response = client.files.create(
                    file=open(temp_file_path, "rb"),
                    purpose="assistants",
                )
                assistant = client.beta.assistants.update(
                    'asst_PWxRJ5oOqEHx0CisVEBpFgKI',
                    file_ids=[file_response.id],
                )
                thread = client.beta.threads.create()
                run = submit_message('asst_PWxRJ5oOqEHx0CisVEBpFgKI', thread, user_query)
                run = wait_on_run(run, thread)
                response_messages = get_response(thread)
                response = pretty_print(response_messages)
                st.text_area("Response:", value=response, height=300)
            except Exception as e:
                st.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Show a message if the API key is not entered
