# Building Generative AI Models with Vertex AI Model Garden and Generative AI Studio by Google

In technology world there is no hotter topic in 2023 than generative AI and it's power for startups and business. Generative AI can be game changer, but sometimes we need to find very specific AI model which will fit best for our purposes. And if it is not exist, only the way - is to create it. In this tutorial I'll introduce you powerful tool for creating, training, customizing and deploying generative models.

## Getting Started

### Exploring Generative AI Studio

**Generative AI Studio** is an extensive platform offered by Google, empowering you to simplify the development and experimentation of state-of-the-art generative models. The platform offer an array of tools and resources at your disposal. Generative AI Studio is a user-friendly interface for creation and training of generative AI models. It has following key features:

- **Model Selection**: You can choose from an extensive range of pre-trained foundation models and APIs available in **Model Garden** like: PaLM for Text, PaLM for Chat, Imagen for text-to-image, Codey for code completion, Chirp for speech-to-tex and many other.

- **Evaluation and Deployment**: Evaluate the performance of your trained models and seamlessly deploy them for inference in real-world applications.

## Building Your Own Generative AI Models

Once you have familiarized yourself with Generative AI Studio and Model Garden, you can embark on building your own generative AI models using the following workflow:

**Define the Problem**: Identify the specific type of generative AI model you wish to create, such as text, image, or audio generation.

**Collect and Preprocess Data**: Gather a suitable dataset and preprocess it to ensure compatibility with your chosen model.

**Choose a Model Architecture**: Select a model from Model Garden that aligns with your project requirements, or consider designing your own custom architecture.

**Train the Model**: Utilize Generative AI Studio with Vertex AI to train your model using the chosen dataset. Experiment with different hyperparameters to achieve superior results.

**Evaluate and Refine**: Carefully assess the generated outputs and iteratively refine your model by adjusting the training process or modifying the architecture as needed.

**Deploy the Model**: Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, deploy it to generate new content or seamlessly integrate it into your existing applications.

## Conclusion

Embark on an exciting journey of generative AI by leveraging the powerful resources provided by **Generative AI Studio** and **Model Garden** by Google, further enhanced by **Vertex AI**. Unleash your creativity and generate innovative content using intuitive interfaces, extensive model libraries, and practical tutorials.
