## Introduction

A [ChatGPT plugin](https://lablab.ai/blog/chatgpt-update-chatgpt-plugins-are-out) is an add-on software developed to integrate external applications into ChatGPT's
AI chatbot, unlocking capabilities beyond ChatGPT's original scope. These plugins facilitate the interface between the application and ChatGPT's API, 
connecting other services and tools to a chatbot, enabling a broader range of features and use cases than initially built in.

In order to make your plugin available to ChatGPT, you need to have [developer access to ChatGPT plugins](https://openai.com/waitlist/plugins), which means you also
need a ChatGPT Plus subscription. In any case, you can still develop the plugin and have it ready for whenever you have that access.

In this tutorial, we will ask ChatGPT to help us come up with ideas for a plugin and also write the code for it. We are then going to deploy our app to 
[replit](https://replit.com) to make it publicly available for ChatGPT to use.


## 🚀 Let's get started!

[Open ChatGPT in your browser](https://chat.openai.com/), and ask it to come up with ideas for a plugin.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA28I2.png" alt="ChatGPT plugin ideas" caption="ChatGPT plugin ideas" />

For simplicity's sake, we are going to choose the first idea: A Currency Exchange Rate converter that allows users to convert between different currencies. But you 
can take any of the suggestions and apply the same process we are going to use to build your own original plugin.

You can now ask ChatGPT to give you a list of APIs that you can use to develop the plugin.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2kml.png" alt="ChatGPT plugin ideas" caption="ChatGPT plugin ideas" />

We will use the second option [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/) because it has a free option that is enough for our use case. [Sign up to the 
free plan to get an API KEY](https://manage.exchangeratesapi.io/signup/). Save that API KEY for later.


## Developing the plugin

Let's copy the [documentation for Exchange Rates API in the API Layer website](https://apilayer.com/marketplace/exchangerates_data-api) and give it to ChatGPT
so it can help us write the endpoints for our plugin. For this use case, we only need to give it the /convert endpoint information.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2O7f.png" alt="Exchange Rates API documentation" caption="Exchange Rates API documentation" />

Make sure you copy the GET /convert endpoint code in Python (it's in Javascript by default).

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2ee4.png" alt="GET /convert endpoint in Python" caption="GET /convert endpoint in Python" />

Paste the documentation into ChatGPT and ask it to write a plugin based on it.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2SXS.png" alt="Copy documentation to ChatGPT" caption="Copy the documentation to ChatGPT" />

You might have to try a few times before getting a good answer.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2UL7.png" alt="Ask ChatGPT to write the code" caption="Ask ChatGPT to write the code" />

Ask it to handle errors and create a Flask app with /convert and all the other endpoints necessary for a completely functional plugin.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2rB9.md.png" alt="Create a Flask app with ChatGPT" caption="Create a Flask app" />

Here is the complete code ChatGPT gave me:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import requests

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
BASE_URL = "https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data"

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/convert", methods=["GET"])
def convert_currency():
    amount = request.args.get("amount")
    from_currency = request.args.get("from")
    to_currency = request.args.get("to")

    url = f"{BASE_URL}/convert"
    headers = {"apikey": API_KEY}
    params = {
        "amount": amount,
        "from": from_currency,
        "to": to_currency
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    if "result" in data:
        converted_amount = data["result"]
        return jsonify({"converted_amount": converted_amount})
    else:
        error_message = data.get("error", "Currency conversion failed.")
        return jsonify({"error": error_message}), 400

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()        
```

Awesome! We are now going to create a replit repo and continue working on our plugin there. [Create a replit account](https://replit.com/) if you haven't already 
and create a new repo.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA241e.md.png" alt="Create replit repo" caption="Create replit repo" />

Copy the code ChatGPT just wrote into main.py file of the replit repo.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA26ru.png" alt="Copy code to replit" caption="Copy code to replit" />

On your replit console, open a New Tab -> Secrets and paste there your Exchange Rates API Key. 

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2idb.md.png" alt="Paste Exchange Rate API Key in Replit repo" caption="Paste Exchange Rate API Key in Replit repo" />

Now modify the code to get the API_KEY from the repository's environment:

```python
import os
...

API_KEY = os.environ["YOUR_API_KEY"] 
```

We a are going to ask ChatGPT to write the rest of the files necessary to build the plugin. Go to [Open AI plugin documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/plugin-manifest), 
copy the documentation under the Plugin Manifest section, give it to ChatGPT and ask it to write a manifest file.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2s7j.png" alt="Copy manifest documentation" caption="Copy manifest documentation" />

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2Lkx.png" alt="ChatGPT manifest" caption="ChatGPT manifest" />

On your replit repo, create an ai-plugin.json file a paste the manifest code there:

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2QmQ.png" alt="AI plugin json" caption="AI plugin json" />

Now go to the [Open API section of the ChatGPT plugin documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/openapi-definition) and repeat the last step.
Copy the text under the Open API definition title, paste it to ChatGPT, and ask it to write an Open API definition for your plugin.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2tIV.png" alt="Open API definition" caption="Open API definition" />

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2DhB.png" alt="ChatGPT's Open API definition" caption="ChatGPT's Open API definition" />

Go back to your replit repo, create a openapi.yaml file and paste the Open API definition code there:

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2bLP.png" alt="Open API definition" caption="Open API definition" />

Finally, we are going to make some changes on the code ChatGPT wrote for us to make it work on our environment.

Open your main.py file and add the missing imports:

```python
import os
from waitress import serve
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
import requests
```

Open a Shell tab on your replit console, and install waitress.

```Shell
pip install waitress
```

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2yEF.png" alt="Install waitress web server" caption="Install waitress web server" />

Then add the following endpoints to serve our manifest and Open API definition files:

```python
@app.route('/.well-known/ai-plugin.json')
def serve_ai_plugin():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'ai-plugin.json', mimetype='application/json')


@app.route('/.well-known/openapi.yaml')
def serve_openapi_yaml():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'openapi.yaml', mimetype='text/yaml')
```

And serve the app through a web server:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    serve(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

Your complete main.py file should look something like this:

```python
import os
from waitress import serve
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, send_from_directory
import requests

API_KEY = os.environ["YOUR_API_KEY"]
BASE_URL = "https://api.apilayer.com/exchangerates_data"

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/convert", methods=["GET"])
def convert_currency():
    amount = request.args.get("amount")
    from_currency = request.args.get("from")
    to_currency = request.args.get("to")

    url = f"{BASE_URL}/convert"
    headers = {"apikey": API_KEY}
    params = {
        "amount": amount,
        "from": from_currency,
        "to": to_currency
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    if "result" in data:
        converted_amount = data["result"]
        return jsonify({"converted_amount": converted_amount})
    else:
        error_message = data.get("error", "Currency conversion failed.")
        return jsonify({"error": error_message}), 400


@app.route('/.well-known/ai-plugin.json')
def serve_ai_plugin():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'ai-plugin.json', mimetype='application/json')


@app.route('/.well-known/openapi.yaml')
def serve_openapi_yaml():
    return send_from_directory('.', 'openapi.yaml', mimetype='text/yaml')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    serve(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

Hit the Run button on top of your replit repo, and wait for the app to be deployed. You should get a replit URL that you need to copy and paste it on your manifest
Open API definition. The URL should look something like this: `https://currency-converter-plugin.< YOUR_REPLIT_USERNAME >.repl.co`

Now open the ai-plugin.json file and paste the Open API definition full path. Here is the complete ai-plugin.json:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "v1",
  "name_for_human": "Currency Converter",
  "name_for_model": "CurrencyConverter",
  "description_for_human": "Plugin for converting currencies using the latest exchange rates.",
  "description_for_model": "Plugin for converting currencies using the latest exchange rates. Use keywords 'convert', 'from', 'to', and 'amount' to prompt the plugin.",
  "auth": {
    "type": "none"
  },
  "api": {
    "type": "openapi",
    "url": "https://currency-converter-plugin.<YOUR_REPLIT_USERNAME>.repl.co/.well-known/openapi.yaml",  // <-- Paste the URL here
    "is_user_authenticated": false
  },
  "logo_url": "https://your-domain.com/logo.png",
  "contact_email": "support@your-domain.com",
  "legal_info_url": "https://www.your-domain.com/legal"
}
```

And in your openapi.yaml file, paste the main URL:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1

          description: The amount to be converted
        converted_amount:
          type: number
          description: The converted amount
```

We're almost there! Go to to the ChatGPT plugin store, and click on "Develop your own plugin".

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA2pB1.png" alt="ChatGPT plugin store" caption="ChatGPT plugin store" />

If prompted, click on the "My manifest is ready" button and give it your app's base URL `https://currency-converter-plugin.< YOUR_REPLIT_USERNAME >.repl.co`.
Continue with the installation and you should now be able to use your plugin. Let's test it!

## 🎁 Bonus: Integrate your plugin with Stable Diffusion

As a little extra, we will expand our plugin's functionality with another AI tool, Stable Diffusion, to generate an image of the conversion we are trying to make.
This will hopefully inspire you to come up with new ideas for the plugin's functionality.

We will use a [Stable Diffusion model hosted on Replicate](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion) so we can get a working URL that ChatGPT can render.
Get your [Replicate API TOKEN if you haven't already](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) and copy it.

Open your main.py file and add the following after your current imports:

```python
import replicate

...
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = os.environ["REPLICATE_API_TOKEN"]
...
```

On your replit repo, add the REPLICATE_API_TOKEN secret and paste the value.

<Img src="https://iili.io/HiA3J2a.png" alt="Add Replicate API TOKEN" caption="Add Replicate API TOKEN" />

You can now call the Stable Diffusion model inside your convert_currency() function to generate images:

```python
@app.route("/convert", methods=["GET"])
def convert_currency():
    amount = request.args.get("amount")
    from_currency = request.args.get("from")
    to_currency = request.args.get("to")

    url = f"{BASE_URL}/convert"
    headers = {"apikey": API_KEY}
    params = {
        "amount": amount,
        "from": from_currency,
        "to": to_currency
    }

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    # Call replicate's Stable Diffusion model
    sd_response = replicate.run(
        "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf",
        input={"prompt": "A high quality image representing the conversion from " + from_currency + " to " + to_currency + " currencies"}
    )

    if "result" in data:
        converted_amount = data["result"]
        return jsonify({"converted_amount": converted_amount, "image": sd_response[1] }) # Add the image URL to your json response
    else:
        error_message = data.get("error", "Currency conversion failed.")
        return jsonify({"error": error_message}), 400
```


## 🤔 Conclusion

In this tutorial, we examined how to construct a ChatGPT plugin for currency conversion and also image generation using Stable Diffusion. Plugins are instrumental 
in broadening ChatGPT's functionality by enabling it to interface with external applications and APIs. You can now create your own plugins or expand this one 
to make something new.
