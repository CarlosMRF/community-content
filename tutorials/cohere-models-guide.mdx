## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

### About Cohere

<a href="https://cohere.com" rel="nofollow">Cohere</a> provides a powerful API that seamlessly integrates state-of-the-art language
processing into any system. By leveraging extensive training, it develops large-scale
language models and encapsulates them within an intuitive API. Additionally, users
have the capability to tailor massive models to suit their specific use cases and
train them using their own data. This means that Cohere takes care of the intricate
tasks associated with amassing vast volumes of text data, managing dynamic neural
network architectures, overseeing distributed training, and ensuring models are available
for use 24/7.

### Cohere Models

Cohere provides a range of models that can be trained and tailored to suit specific use cases. This tutorial will guide you through the process of utilizing
the [Generate](https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere/generate), the [Embed](https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere/embed), and the [Rerank](https://lablab.ai/tech/cohere/rerank) models, while also
illustrating some of their use cases. For this purpose, we will progressively create a simple Streamlit app that will make use of these three models.

### Requirements

1. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/" rel="nofollow">Python 3.9+</a>
2. A <a href="https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys" rel="nofollow">Cohere Api Key</a>


## Setting up

Let's start by creating a new folder and installing the necessary libraries.

```bash
mkdir cohere-app
cd cohere-app
pip install cohere streamlit annoy numpy python-dotenv
```

Now, let's create an .env file.

```bash
touch .env
```

And save our Cohere Api Key there.

(Dont' worry, that's not my real Api Key ðŸ˜‰)


## ðŸš€ Building the app

We will build our Streamlit app in 3 steps, each one showcasing the capabilities of one of the Cohere Models, while also expanding the features of our app.

Create a main.py file, where we will write all the code.

```bash
touch main.py
```

Open main.py and load the libraries and env variable at the top:

```python
import cohere
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from annoy import AnnoyIndex
import numpy as np
import streamlit as st

load_dotenv()

co = cohere.Client(os.getenv('COHERE_API_KEY'))
```

### 1- Cohere Generate

Cohere Generate creates text based on an input. It basically tries to guess what is the best way to continue a piece text. If you give a question it will 
generate an answer, which makes it the ideal model for summarization and building Chatbots.

Let's ask it to recommend us a list of books based on a given topic. We will save this list in a text file output.txt to use it later with the other models. In the main.py file,
write the following code:

```python
st.subheader('Book list Generator and Ranker:')

# Topic input
topic = st.text_input("Topic", placeholder="Topic",
                      label_visibility="collapsed")

if st.button("Generate"):
    try:
        with st.spinner("Please wait..."):
            # Load the Cohere Generate module
            response = co.generate(prompt="Write a list of the 5 most popular books about " +
                                   topic+" with a short description for each one.")

            # Write the results in a text file for future use
            with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
                f.write(response.generations[0].text)

            # Show the results on the front end
            st.success(response.generations[0].text)
    except Exception as e:
        st.exception(f"Exception: {e}")
```

Now run the app with:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

You should see your app runing on localhost:8501.

Choose a topic and prompt the model. The results should display and be saved in the root of your app.

### 2- Cohere Embed

Cohere Embed processes a piece of text and generates an embedding, which is a set of floating-point numbers (vectors) that encapsulate semantic information related to the represented text. 
This characteristic imparts a sense of 'understanding' to AI models in regard to human language, and proves beneficial in constructing classification and semantic search systems.

In the subsequent step, we will employ this model to generate embeddings using the data we produced earlier. Within the main.py file, append the following code at the end.

```python
if os.path.isfile('output.txt'):
    st.subheader('Semantic search:')
    query = st.text_input("Query", placeholder="Query",
                          label_visibility="collapsed")
    if st.button("Query"):
        try:
            with st.spinner("Please wait..."):

                # Load the list generated in last step and save it in an array after removing irrelevant lines
                with open('output.txt') as f:
                    lines = list(filter(None, f.read().splitlines()))[1:]

                # Load theCohere Embed module
                embeds = co.embed(
                    texts=lines,
                    model='small',
                ).embeddings

                # Create the search index, pass the size of embedding
                search_index = AnnoyIndex(np.array(embeds).shape[1], 'angular')

                # Add all the vectors to the search index
                for i in range(len(embeds)):
                    search_index.add_item(i, embeds[i])
                search_index.build(10)  # 10 trees
                search_index.save('embeds.ann')

                print(embeds)

                # Embed the query
                query_embed = co.embed(texts=[query],
                                       model="embed-english-v2.0").embeddings

                # Retrieve the nearest neighbor
                similar_item_id = search_index.get_nns_by_vector(query_embed[0], 1,
                                                                 include_distances=False)

                # Show the results on the front end
                st.success(similar_item_id[0].text)
        except Exception as e:
            st.exception(f"Exception: {e}")
```

Save and refresh the app.

Following the execution of a query, this code will load the contents of output.txt, generate and display the embeddings in your terminal 
(solely for educational purposes; you may choose to remove the print() function later), and subsequently store them in the file embeds.ann.

<Img src="https://iili.io/J3MqR7p.md.png" caption="Vectorized Poetry" alt="Vectorized Poetry" />

It will then create embeddings for the query, and compare the distance between both. This is called a semantic search.

### 3- Cohere Rerank

Cohere Rerank takes a list of documents and a query as input, and returns the same list reorganized based on a score derived from semantic similarity with the query. 
This functionality is valuable for significantly enhancing the effectiveness of conventional search systems that rely on keyword matching.

Just as we did with Embed, we will formulate a query and instruct the model to provide us with ranked results. Insert the following code at the end of your main.py file.

```python
if os.path.isfile('output.txt'):
    st.subheader('Semantic similarity ranking:')
    query = st.text_input("Rerank", placeholder="Query",
                          label_visibility="collapsed")

    if st.button("Rerank"):
        try:
            with st.spinner("Please wait..."):

                # Load the list generated in last step and save it in an array after removing irrelevant lines
                with open('output.txt') as f:
                    lines = list(filter(None, f.read().splitlines()))[1:]

                # Load the Cohere Rerank module
                results = co.rerank(
                    query=query, documents=lines, top_n=5, model='rerank-english-v2.0')

                # Parse the results 
                results_string = ""
                for idx, r in enumerate(results):
                    results_string += f"{r.document['text']}\n\n"
                    results_string += f"Relevance Score: {r.relevance_score:.2f}\n"
                    results_string += "\n"

                # Show the results on the frontend
                st.success(results_string)
        except Exception as e:
            st.exception(f"Exception: {e}")
```

Save and refresh the app.

Let's make another query and see the results:

Awesome ðŸ¥³. We have just created a basic recommendation system.


### ðŸ‘€ A closer look on Rerank use case

Before wrapping up, let's dive a little deeper on what is possible with Rerank. 

For decades, Google has maintained its position as the leading search engine, despite often delivering sub-optimal results and irrelevant content. However, this era of dominance is now 
facing a significant challenge from AI-powered search methods that diverge from the traditional keyword-based approach.

Consider a nuanced search on Google, such as 'break the ice'. The options presented are either a standard 'search' that inundates you with a plethora of internet content to sift through, 
or an 'I am feeling lucky' option for those confident in their search's commonality. In contrast, semantic-based search systems excels at understanding the essence of a user's query beyond
mere keyword matching. This capability leads to the retrieval of more pertinent and precise results.

Cohere's Rerank endpoint serves as a crucial bridge in this paradigm shift. Notably, Rerank not only surpasses the quality of results obtained through embedding-based search but also 
requires just a single line of code alteration in your application.

<Img src="https://iili.io/J3MqTrv.png" caption="Rerank results" alt="Rerank results" />

The data shown demonstrates that lexical search manages to yield relevant results for roughly 44% of search queries on average. Consequently, for the majority of queries, users find no pertinent 
information within the top three results. Embedding-based semantic search boosts this figure to 65%, while Rerank achieves even higher performance. For approximately 72% of search queries, 
we successfully present the most pertinent result within the first three outcomes (<a href='https://txt.cohere.com/rerank/' rel="nofollow">Source</a>).

Furthermore, Rerank is compatible with embedding-based semantic search, further enhancing the quality of results obtained.


## ðŸ¤” Final Thoughts

In this tutorial, we learned how to use Cohere's Generate, Embed and Rerank models in one application, and how to create data and query it in an optimal fashion. You could use this knowledge to
improve existing search systems for businesses and organizations that have large banks of data. Or maybe enhance the user experience of surfing through the web.
 
Lastly, you could easily deploy this app by uploading it to Github and connecting the repository to the Streamlit platform.
