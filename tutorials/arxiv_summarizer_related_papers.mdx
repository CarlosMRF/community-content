#Introduction
The sheer volume of research articles on platforms like arXiv makes it challenging for scholars to digest and stay updated with the latest findings.
Summarizing long-form articles into key points can help researchers quickly grasp the essence of a paper and discern its relevance.
Furthermore, identifying similar papers can aid in contextualizing the current study within the broader academic discourse, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and avoiding redundant research efforts.

#Solution
In this article, we will build a solution using Langchain, Annoy and GPT3.5

## Prerequisites

You need to have <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/" rel="nofollow">Python 3.9</a> and pip installed, 

Install the following packages using pip
```bash
pip install annoy
pip install langchain
pip install openai
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install torch
```
or create a requirements.txt file and install the packages using the command <b> pip install -r requirements.txt </b>

```bash
numpy==1.25.2
torch==2.0.1
annoy==1.17.3
langchain==0.0.237

{/*To add image to your tutorial use <Img/> component with params:*/}
{/*<Img src={path_to_your_img}, alt={img_alt}, caption={short_img_caption_below_it}*/}
{/*This is just a template for tutorials .mdx*/}
{/*Please yse mainly ##, ###, #### for headings, don't use number e.g. '1. abc' in front of them (if not needed)*/}
{/*After creation of tutorial (and techs if needed), go to /tutorial and add your tutorial. Image and description will be automaticly downloaded from this file.*/}
