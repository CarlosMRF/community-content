## Introduction
Participating in the hackathons is a great way to learn new things and meet new people. You can learn new things from the mentors and other participants or even win the prize. 
But, you should be careful when you are participating in the hackathons. You should protect your API key in the demo product in the hackathons. Otherwise, someone can steal your API key and use it for their own purpose. 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to protect your API key in the demo projects.


## Let's get started

First thing first. Open Visual Studio Code and click `Clone Repository`.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the command line. Open your terminal and run the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdibrokhim/PaLM2-Tutorial
```

Then, go to the directory.

```bash
cd PaLM2-Tutorial
```

After, successfully cloning the repository open `app.py` file. Here you should see the following lines of code.

```bash 
with st.sidebar:
    palm_api_key = st.text_input('PaLM API Key', key='palm_api_key')
```

What `st.sidebar` actually does? It creates a sidebar in the web app with input field, where everyone can input their own PaLM API key. 
It's a good practice to protect your API key in the demo product in the hackathons. You can see the sidebar in the following image.

Otherwise, you may create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project. Then, add the following line of code.

```bash
palm_api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

After that, open `app.py` file add the following lines of code.

```bash
import os
palm_api_key = os.getenv('palm_api_key')
```

Now, create a file named `.gitignore` in the root directory of your project. Then, add the `.env` to don't push the file to the GitHub repository.

```bash
.env
```
