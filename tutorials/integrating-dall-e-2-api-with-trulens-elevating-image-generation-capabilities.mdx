### DALL·E 2 Overview

DALL·E 2 is a cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to generate images from textual descriptions. Utilizing advanced algorithms, DALL·E 2 transforms text prompts into visually compelling images resembling human-created drawings, paintings, and photographs.

#### How DALL·E 2 Works

1. **Input**: Users provide a textual description of a visual scene as a prompt.
2. **Processing**: DALL·E 2 algorithmically interprets the prompt and generates corresponding imagery.
3. **Output**: Instantaneously, DALL·E 2 produces an image reflecting the input prompt.

### Key Features

- **Generative AI**: DALL·E 2 harnesses generative AI techniques to create diverse and realistic visual representations.
- **Text-to-Image Transformation**: Seamlessly converts textual descriptions into visually interpretable images.
- **Human-like Imagery**: Generates images resembling human-made drawings, paintings, and photographs.

### Repository for Integration

For integrating DALL·E 2 into your application and leveraging its image generation capabilities, you can refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/feliciien/integrating-dall-e-2-api-with-trulens-elevating-image-generation-capabilities) provided by Feliciien. This repository offers insights and resources to fork and run the application effectively.


# Deploying the App Locally

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the Streamlit app to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feliciien/integrating-dall-e-2-api-with-trulens-elevating-image-generation-capabilities
cd dall-e
# Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for the app.

```bash
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
## Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 4: Integrate TruLens Evals

Implement TruLens Evals to enhance the DALL-E 2 output. Follow TruLens documentation https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n77IGrPDO2XpeIVo_LQW0gY78enV-tY9?usp=sharing#scrollTo=Osch8gN27v1s or integration guide for specific instructions.

```bash
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install trulens
!{sys.executable} -m pip install torchvision
!{sys.executable} -m pip install matplotlib

## Step 5: Create and Activate a Conda Environment for DALL-E

Create a Conda environment named "dall-e" to isolate the dependencies for the app.

```bash
conda create -n dall-e
## Activate the "dall-e" Environment

Activate the "dall-e" environment using the following command:

```bash
conda activate dall-e
## Install Necessary Libraries

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain trulens-eval openai
## Set Up Streamlit Secrets

To incorporate your OpenAI API key and HuggingFace Access Token into Streamlit secrets, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file within your project directory:

```bash
touch .streamlit/secrets.toml
## Configure API Keys

To configure your API keys for OpenAI and HuggingFace, follow these steps:

1. Open the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project directory.

2. Add the following lines to the file, replacing `"YOUR_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"` with your respective keys:

```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
## Step 6: Run the Streamlit App

Run the Streamlit app using the `streamlit` command.

```bash
streamlit run main.py
## Step 7: Access the App

Access the Streamlit app in your web browser by navigating to the URL provided by Streamlit, typically [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
