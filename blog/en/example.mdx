The lablab.ai 3D AI Models Hackathon brought together 769 participants forming 87 teams who collectively developed 19 [impressive AI applications](https://lablab.ai/apps). These applications showcased the versatility and power of the 3D generative models. Here are the top three winners:

### **DesignDive - 1st Place ðŸ¥‡**

[DesignDive](https://lablab.ai/event/3d-ai-models-hackathon/designdive/designdive)'s project aimed to democratize 3D modeling by using Shap-e and other text-to-3D model technologies. By simply describing room layouts or furniture arrangements through text prompts, this innovation allows interior designers, decorators, game developers, animators, architects, and urban planners to visualize their ideas quickly and efficiently. DesignDive's approach empowers both professionals and clients to experiment with aesthetics and layouts, making the design process more collaborative and creative.

### **Archiflow Dream Design with AI - 2nd Place ðŸ¥ˆ**

[Archiflow Dream Design with AI](https://lablab.ai/event/3d-ai-models-hackathon/maverick/archiflow-dream-design-with-ai) is a groundbreaking project that harnesses advanced AI to revolutionize architectural design. By converting text descriptions into intricate 3D architectural models, Archiflow makes architecture accessible to a wide range of creators. It enables real-time design, incorporating virtual and augmented reality for immersive exploration, ultimately shaping a more inclusive, sustainable, and visually stunning architectural future.
