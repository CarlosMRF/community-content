We also want to thank the incredible lablab.ai team working behind the scenes to make this community possible. Their dedication to our mission, support of members, and continual platform improvements have been vital to reaching 100,000 members. We are grateful for all of their efforts in building a collaborative home for AI innovation.

When we started lablab.ai, our mission was to motivate talent worldwide to innovate with cutting-edge AI, unite people across borders, and facilitate the creation of solutions that move industries and society forward.

We focus on innovating with emerging technologies without stating a specific problem to solve. This allows for more creative freedom and discoveries. And by bringing together AI builders, we spark interesting collaborations that may not have happened otherwise.

Our hackathons and workshops provide opportunities for people to build real solutions while removing barriers to get started. And the broader lablab.ai community connects members for ongoing learning, support and inspiration beyond any single event.

For those who excel in our hackathons, you now have a gateway to potentially launch your own startup through partnerships with accelerator programs like Slingshot and GAIA. [Slingshot](https://slingshot.newnative.ai/) helps refine your concepts and MVPs, while [GAIA](https://gaia.newnative.ai/) offers an intensive 10-week program to bring your project to the next level. We're so excited to help bootstrap the next generation of AI startups!

**Thank you again to all 100,000+ lablab.ai community members across the globe. We look forward to seeing what incredible innovations we can continue accomplishing together!**

**Let the era of AI creativity prosper. ðŸš€**
