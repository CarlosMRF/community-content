## **Event Overview**

[Edge Runners Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/edge-runners-3-point-2) brought together 1,089 participants across 180 teams, all eager to innovate using the cutting-edge capabilities of Meta's Llama 3.2. Over an intense 48-hour challenge, participants developed 45 groundbreaking AI applications, demonstrating the vast potential of Llama 3.2's multimodal processing and real-time AI capabilities.

This hackathon empowered developers to build powerful applications optimized for mobile and IoT devices, leveraging lightweight models designed for edge computing. From text and image processing to augmented reality and advanced image recognition, participants explored a wide range of AI solutions

## **üåü Hackathon Challenge**

The challenge for the Edge Runners Hackathon tasks participants with building an edge compute solution using the full spectrum of Llama models. Developers must create a solution optimized to run on mobile or IoT platforms, utilizing lightweight models like Llama 3.2 1B or 3B for real-time operations. However, teams have two options to enhance their solutions with more powerful models. They can either integrate network-enabled features, allowing their application to tap into larger models, such as Llama 3.1 405B or Llama 3.2‚Äôs multimodal models (11B, 90B), for tasks like complex data analysis or multimodal processing. Alternatively, they can use larger models during development for purposes like generating synthetic data or labeling, fine-tuning their smaller models to ensure the final solution is optimized for edge devices. The end goal is to produce a high-performing, edge-ready application that balances local processing with optional network-enhanced AI capabilities.

### Side Quest Challenge

The Side Quest Challenge invites participants to develop AI-powered tools for the telecommunications industry, focusing on underserved areas. Teams must use at least two Llama 3.1 or 3.2 models, demonstrating both lightweight and multimodal capabilities. Solutions should creatively address key industry needs like workflow optimization or connectivity improvements, with a focus on real-world impact. Bonus: solutions compatible with edge devices will also qualify for the main track challenge.
