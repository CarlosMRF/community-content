# 

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently [announced](https://www.edgemiddleeast.com/emergent-tech/saudi-arabia-pledges-1b-to-an-ai-startup-accelerator) its $1 billion USD support for the generative AI ecosystem at the LEAP tech conference.  This  marks a significant step towards the country’s ambition to become a global leader in artificial intelligence. Part of this commitment will go towards supporting New Native Inc’s vision and progress via its GAIA (Generative AI Accelerator) program which is run in partnership with NTDP and SDAIA, while the remainder extends across the entire generative AI sector, including startups, infrastructure, and capital investment. GAIA, hosted at The Garage in King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), aims to create 300 high-impact AI companies within 36 months. This initiative reflects Saudi Arabia's commitment to fostering innovation and advancing its position in the AI revolution.

As an organization focused on accelerating the AI-native economy, New Native Inc is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence industry, aiming to drive human progress forward through innovation. By successfully exporting their GAIA global initiative, and doing that in collaboration with the National Technology Development Program (NTDP) and the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), it underlines a commitment to transforming innovative ideas into successful AI-driven businesses.

By fostering a nurturing environment for AI startups, Saudi Arabia and New Native Inc are not just supporting AI technology; they are investing in its future. This collaborative effort is a testament to the power of vision, innovation, and strategic partnerships in driving the global AI agenda forward.

In summary, Saudi Arabia's growing investment in the AI ecosystem, with New Native Inc and its GAIA program playing a key part, is more than just a financial infusion. It represents a pivotal element in shaping the future of global AI development, making it an exciting space to watch in the coming years.
