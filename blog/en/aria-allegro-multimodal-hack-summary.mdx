## **üåü Hackathon Challenge**

Aria & Allegro Multimodal Hackathon challenged participants to design intelligent applications that integrate multiple data types‚Äîtext, images, video, and code‚Äîinto practical, high-impact solutions. Using Rhymes AI‚Äôs powerful models, Aria and Allegro, teams were encouraged to build innovative tools with real-world applications, such as smarter healthcare diagnostics, automated content creation, and enhanced customer service solutions. 

Aria provided the ability to handle diverse data inputs cohesively, while Allegro enabled unique text-to-video transformations for media projects. Participants were required to use one of these models as the core of their applications, either building on or fine-tuning it, and to submit open-source projects via GitHub.

## **üöÄ Exclusive access to Rhymes technology**

Rhymes AI initially offered exclusive early access to Aria and Allegro‚Äôs APIs to only ten teams for the Aria & Allegro Multimodal Hackathon. Interested participants registered and formed teams on lablab.ai, and Rhymes AI carefully selected the most qualified teams based on their submissions. Selected teams received email notifications granting them access to these powerful APIs, allowing them to explore and build with Rhymes AI‚Äôs latest multimodal technology.

However, as interest grew and more qualified teams applied, Rhymes AI increased the number of API keys, ultimately providing 24 teams with access. This expansion enabled a wider group of participants to create high-impact applications, fully utilizing Aria and Allegro‚Äôs capabilities and enriching the hackathon with even more innovative solutions.
